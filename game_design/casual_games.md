TITLE Why Pure "Casual" Games Are Degenerate
NAV Why Pure "Casual" Games Are Degenerate

People play competitive games for an emotional reason: to try; to grow so that their trying means more; to conquer something that once conquered them. <!--This desire is if anything the polar opposite of degeneracy.--> Many games also are bundled with stories, but if the story is the only good thing about the game [it shouldn't be formatted as a game](ff13_interactive).

Games with no challenge - like Lego games - and no story are degenerate because the *only* reason left to play them is [empowerment](/protagonism/emotions): the low feeling of "I can make stuff blow up on a screen by pressing a button! Cool!" In other words, if you like such games, you value power in a completely imaginary world.

Competitive games are not so because the point of them is not the in-universe power but the out-of-universe *skill*: nobody plays [Prismata](/reviews/prismata) to blow stuff up or [Dark Souls](/reviews/dark_souls) to kill monsters. People play those games to use and grow their skill at the game. <!--experience the progression from failure through growth to success.--> And that *skill* itself is *not* imaginary: it's a mental adeptness possessed by the real you, not by your avatar in a game world. The challenge you overcome and that is the source of your enjoyment is not the one faced by a sprite or an imaginary character, but the one *you*, a real person, face against the game, a real object. Casual games are degenerate because their appeal is purely the power over something imaginary; competitive games are not degenerate because their appeal is the struggle against a real obstacle - toward a goal with itself token value - that exercises real mental abilities, and in a way that reflects the growth arc of many real-world endeavors.

Lego Star Wars and similar games may serve legitimately as a "gateway into gaming": a lot of older adults that grew up without video games are kind of phobic of them and it's possible that playing a game like this could help them to see that the medium isn't "some newfangled thing for youngsters" or "for hardcore competitors only".

A legitimate ["casual game"](roles) is one like Codenames or Dominion; one that has skill and allows trying, but also allows enjoying it without being into it.
<!--
Here's a way of looking at it: if you don't want to be challenged, then you don't want to play a game. Challenge is the only 
thing unique to games. If you're plyaing for the story, what you really want is to read a novel or watch a movie or something. 
It's totally valid to play a story game on the easiest difficulty because there's no way to separate the story from the game. 
But making a game specifically for that is wrong.

Candy Crush is arguably not even a game because neither winning nor losing has any meaning. Winning just means you can keep 
wasting time and losing means it's time to pay money so you can continue wasting time.

Let me stick up for Spoons. Spoons may seem like an obvious include in what I'm criticizing. But when I played Spoons, it was 
all about the humor. It was hilarious to notice the spoons being taken and take one and watch everybody else waiting for them 
to notice it and then either the sudden explosion of hands reaching for a spoon or the last person's expression when they 
realized the game was over before they even noticed it starting.
