TITLE Why Geometry Dash is addicting

I've found Geometry Dash surprisingly hard to quit. I go through the "endless 'one more try'" pattern more intensely than with any other game. There are a couple of obvious reasons:

* Because retries are automatic.

* Because each try is short so it's easy to convince yourself to try again.

But there's a less obvious factor that casts a much darker light on the game:

* Because losses are unsatisfying.

And we don't like to end on an unsatisfying note.

Why are losses unsatisfying?

* Because they're completely sudden.

* Because they rarely involve a lesson. Most Geometry Dash deaths are "fuck, I *know* not to jump there but I keep doing it anyway".

* Because the level is the same every time, so there's no new experience at all unless you improve your record.
