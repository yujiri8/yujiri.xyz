Actually, that brings me to another aspect of the beauty of Go. Go feels like it's almost as much a battle of willpower as it of intellect. I think there are a few reasons for this.

"Risk versus reward" is one of the most frequent dichotomies you encounter, even though the game is completely deterministic. There's so much depth of possibilities you're never sure you're prepared to handle them all. "Ambition versus caution" is another way of putting it.

As a result of that and the game's sheerly incredible depth, hope is almost never lost if you don't want to admit that it is. If you think you're losing a fight, you can almost always try something crazy that stakes even more on it, and sometimes it saves your group, but other times it just loses more. There are so many possibilities in every position that it's nearly impossible to say who actually had the theoretical win in a situation, so you usually never find out for certain. And that leads to the feeling of "it's not the stones, it's you. You only fail if it's your will that fails. If you try harder you can always save it or take some compensation".
