TITLE Unfair Difficulty In Games: Unexplained Rules
NAV Trial and error

Most modern video games have pretty complex rules, and very few of them explain them all up-front. Sometimes this is even deliberate; designers or fans raise an argument like "Exploring and figuring the rules out for yourself is part of the game". This defense is frankly asinine.

If I don't know the rules of a game, then it's not a legitimate challenge. If I don't know how much damage the fireball spell does before I invest in it, I cannot make a meaningful decision. I'm just guessing what the designer would've done. That's not challenging gameplay. It's trial and error.
<!--
One of the most pervasive forms of trial and error, especially in RPGs, is hiding quantitative information.
If a spell's description just says, "deals fire damage to an enemy", with no indication of, you know,
<i>how much</i>, then how the fuck am I suppposed to decide whether I should learn this spell? Without
<i>quantitative</i> information, all decisions are blind. That's not gameplay, it's arbitrary guessing where
you're punished for not reading the developers' minds.-->

Of course, that's a lot less bad if the game allows you to re-spec or sell an item for the same price, but even then, just why? There's no reason I should have to buy it and go die with it to find out it's not worth buying. Just give me the information up-front so I can make a meaningful decision.

Another frequent cause of trial and error in action games is requiring you to read an enemy's physical sprite movements to know what attack is coming in time to dodge it. The problem with this is that video game worlds aren't bound by real-life physics, so it's often not possible for even the most attentive and smartest player to correctly infer how they should dodge an attack they haven't seen before. The safest way to avoid this is clearly teaching the player what means what (or at least allowing them to practice it in a situation where there are no consequences for failure), although [Mario and Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story](bowsers_inside_story) and [Jedi: Fallen Order](/reviews/jedi_fallen_order) demonstrate that it's possible to do the telegraphs in such a way that the player can reasonably intuit them.

A common reason players don't object to trial and error in games is because they don't realize it's trial and error. They haven't really put their finger on the concept, and so they often assume their death is their fault without even asking whether they had a legitimate way to see it coming. I even did this to myself when I played [Dark Souls 1](/reviews/dark_souls). There were a lot of times I was killed during combat by an attack I couldn't have known how to dodge, but I thought to myself, "Well, there was a telegraph and it was possible to avoid it, so it must have been fair". I denied my feelings because I didn't see how it was possible for that to still be trial and error.
<!--That doesn't excuse designers creating trial and error mechanics.-->

        Every <a href="/reviews/dark_souls">Dark Souls</a> game relies on this. The recently-released <a
        href="/reviews/sekiro">Sekiro</a> is particularly bad. So I jump off a ledge and find myself in a surprise boss
        fight against <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBm3wnQH32M">a twelve-foot tall man on a twelve-foot tall horse
        with a halberd as big as my body</a>. The rational instinct is "yikes, I wasn't prepared for this and I need to escape"
        (all surprise bosses up to this point have allowed fleeing the arena.) As I search for a way out that isn't magically
        blocked by a fog gate that wasn't there before, Gyoubu charges at me and I rationally assume I need to dodge to the side
        to avoid being plowed to death by the horse. Nope; he hits me the spear. I died before I even tried to attack him
        because each failure to dodge was more proof that I wasn't prepared for this fight and I needed to find a way out. Well
        apparently the solution is to block him. That's right; I can stand my ground and block this giant man with a weapon that
        should have enough force to send me flying. And the horse magically never plows me because then the fight would work the
        way physics and logic say it should work instead of the way the designers decided it should work without telling me.
        </p><p>
        So lesson learned, you can block basically anything in this game. Momentum is irrelevant. It's BS that I died that one time bu
t okay. I get to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBG3qkZp8mc">this apparently normal human samurai</a> later and... what? His
 attacks just penetrate my blocks? How the hell was I supposed to know that?

        You fight two bosses at once and focus your attacks on one of them only to find that if they don't die at the same time the re
maining one heals the dead one to full health (Throne Watcher & Throne Defender, also Dark Souls 2).
