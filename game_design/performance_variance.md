TITLE Performance variance

I've touched on performance variance in my [randomness](rng) article and gave Prismata as an example of a game that has a lot of it with no randomness. But . Prismata achieves its performance variance by having a few decisions (the first few turns) meet a few criteria:

* They have the highest skill ceiling in the game. A good player plays close to optimally for most of the duration of most Prismata matches, but even the best players occasionally choose the wrong opening.

* There are few options to pick from, so a guess based on a poor understanding of Prismata theory is reasonably likely to be correct.

* They are the most important decisions in the game.

Combined, these factors mean that a weaker player has a significant chance of playing a better opening than a stronger player, and that if they do, they have a high chance of winning the game.

If you can have a few decisions in your game copy these traits, you can replicate Prismata's performance variance.

It's worth saying that in general, this combination of traits is likely to entail a frustrating faux [feedback loop](feedback_loops) as one early mistake can trump a match full of better decisions. Prismata has a solution for that too which should hopefully be copied at the same time: it's not obvious who's winning. I explain this in the feedback loop article.
