TITLE The Pitfall of Brute-Froce Skills In Game Design

<p>
Brute-force skills are a pitfall in game design that appear to be an easy means to extreme <a href="depth">competitive
depth</a>, but aren't satisfying to play because they misunderstand they point of depth.
</p><p>
If your combat system consists of "react fast enough to avoid damage and counterattack; tougher enemies just require faster
reactions and have higher health/damage", then your game won't be able to get very hard because reaction speed is somewhat of a
brute-force skill. Players can't become reaction gods just by practicing.
</p><p>
In fact this is the primary pitfall that kills my own game <a href="/ci">Counterplay Infinity</a>. It has a few different
moves but there's mostly still an obviously best one in every situation and the game is really just about reacting in time.
I set out to create a game where you never take damage without making a mistake and I achieved that and only that.
On the bright side, designing that game taught me to understand brute force skills and why they're not legitimate depth.
</p><p>
To make satisfying depth, you have to offer meaningful decisions, not just demand superhuman reactions. Another skill like this
is button mashing speed: screw games that make you tap a button six times a second to escape a grab or something. That's not
skill. You can either do it or you can't and it's mostly a physical limitation.
</p><p>
That exact one is actually why I was forced to abandon my <a href="difficulty_settings">hardest-difficulty</a> playthrough of
The Force Unleashed 2. On the final mission, I needed to rapid-tap a button to force open a door and because the designers are
morons the required frequency scales with the combat difficulty (which, also because the designers are morons, is
unadjustable inside of a playthrough... idiots), I just couldn't tap it fast enough.
</p><p>
<a href="/reviews/sekiro">Sekiro</a>, for all its BS trial and error and other flaws, is a great example of a
combat system that's extremely deep but still easy to understand. Well, easy to understand if you were told what
the hell it is, I mean.
