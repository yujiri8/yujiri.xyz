One of the main ways to bore your player if you're making an action game (or really any kind of game, but it's especially
relevant to action games) is having significant periods of time where the player has no control. People play games because they
want to <i>play</i> games. And if you don't have control then you're not playing.
<!--
If you're writing an action game combat system, the player should never go any meaningful length of time without control of
their character; if they do then they're not playing and consequently not having fun.
-->
This issue can be seen in any game with combos that can't be escaped once you've been hit by the first strike, or enemies that
grab you and leave you helpless for several seconds while you slowly take damage (I'm looking at you <a
href="/reviews/dark_souls">Dark Souls</a>). Dragon Ball FighterZ is by far the worst offender I've ever seen. In that game
it's not uncommon to be left watching your opponent play a singleplayer game for ten seconds or more, and there are even ways to
kill someone from full health without giving them any input after your first hit lands. It actually killed the game for me.
</p><p>
Here's what game designers should do instead: allow a player being comboed to escape or begin blocking with a precisely timed
button press, and if necessary, increase the damage of the strikes to compensate (or perhaps punish players for trying to escape
but having bad timing). You haven't really changed the balance of the game and you've made it more engaging for players who are
getting beat up. Why not?
<!--Now you may think I'm being a little unreasonable advocating for the complete removal of "true combos" from all games. But just what purpose do they serve, exactly? If you can't escape the combo,
why isn't it just one attack? In a game like DBFZ, it's a little more defensible because it takes real skill to continue the combo, but in games where it doesn't, I really don't see the draw, and
I've already made the downside clear. --><!--I want to see a game where I never have to stop playing unless the game is loading (still undesirable but inevitable to some extent), or it's time for me to
go do work...-->

Oh, and did I mention that unskippable cutscenes are <b>fucking horseshit</b>?!? Why in all the hells would you force a player
to watch something they might have already seen? Even if it's the first time they've seen it on the current playthrough, you
can't know that they haven't played the game before on a different device, or seen somebody else play parts of it.
