TITLE MC's Revenge

<p>
MC's Revenge is a fan work I made for <a href="/reviews/ddlc">Doki Doki Literature Club</a>. The premise is that starting with Act 2, MC starts to become meta-aware like Monika, seeing the graphical glitches and everything. He doesn't yet realize what's happening or remember Act 1, but he might, depending on your choices.

The mod is on version 1.1.2, which I expect to be the last update I ever make. Download link is <a href="MCs_Revenge.zip">here</a> (<a href="MCs_Revenge-1.1.1.zip">backup version 1.1.1</a> if that doesn't work - the only difference is some minor technical improvements). You install it the same way you do most mods: extract the zip file and drop everything into the /game/ directory of a normal DDLC installation. You might have to delete 'firstrun' inside the folder too. Credits are distributed with the download, in 'credits.txt'.
