TEMPLATE DEFAULT

<p>There are 5 endings in the game. Here's how it determines which one you get: <span class="spoiler">There's an internal variable called "mc_awareness", which
is a list of binary flags. Most of your choices throughout the game set one of them if you pick the correct option. Near the end, a check is made on how many
flags you've set, and that is the main thing that determines your ending. There are 13 flags, and it is possible to have all of them. Specifically, the flags
are for:</span>
<ol>
<li><span class="spoiler">Trying to make MC refuse to check out the literature club at first</span></li>
<li><span class="spoiler">Trying to make MC say that he reads horror on day 1 (he doesn't end up saying it, but it triggers the lines later in the
conversation where he thinks about the horror book he read, "I think it ended with the main character's girlfriend hanging herself out of
depression."</span></li>
<li><span class="spoiler">Trying to make MC accept the invitation to officially join the literature club even without any convincing</span></li>
<li><span class="spoiler">Seeing the first poem-triggered Sayori dream (write your first poem as "bittersweet")</span></li>
<li><span class="spoiler">Correctly remembering what Parfait Girls is about</span></li>
<li><span class="spoiler">Correctly remembering what Portrait of Markov is about</span></li>
<li><span class="spoiler">Skipping dialogue during Yuri and Natsuki's argument (it causes a different scene where MC doesn't pass out)</span></li>
<li><span class="spoiler">Checking the poster at the end of day 2 (choose to "stay and look around")</span></li>
<li><span class="spoiler">Second poem-triggered Sayori dream (write the second poem about guilt)</span></li>
<li><span class="spoiler">Seeing Yuri cutting herself in the hallway</span></li>
<li><span class="spoiler">After that scene, loading a save so MC can stop her (it's the only time loading a save changes what happens, because other times
the game overwrites your save as soon as MC would have a reason to go back)</span></li>
<li><span class="spoiler">Seeing Natsuki's neck snap (this scene is in the original game; it's triggered if you saw Natsuki's first exclusive scene, and
would have seen her second if Yuri hadn't pressured you into reading with her instead)</span></li>
<li><span class="spoiler">Third poem-triggered Sayori dream (write the final poem about suicide)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Ending list:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The Bad Ending: <span class="spoiler">MC doesn't figure out what's happening in time, and Yuri dies. MC and Natsuki confront Monika, and after she
admits the truth and asks the player to pick her, they kill her. Since too many characters have died, however, the game is too broken to revive Yuri
and Sayori by putting their character files back. MC and Natsuki must make what they can of their horrible life confined to a fake and broken reality with
most of their friends dead. This ending happens if your flag count is less than (9, -1 if you loaded a save to stop Yuri from cutting herself, -1 if you
didn't see the third Yuri exclusive or walked out on her during it) when the time comes to save Yuri.</span></p></li>
<li><p>The Medium Ending: <span class="spoiler">MC saves Yuri, but doesn't remember Sayori. MC, Yuri and Natsuki all confront Monika and kill her after she
admits the truth. However, killing Monika broke the game too much to revive Sayori, and Yuri's mental condition is still near the breaking point, but at
least they have the three of them. With luck, they'll be able to keep Yuri from going off the deep end, now that Yuri knows those thoughts are the result of
an external force tampering with her mind. This ending happens if you have enough flags to save Yuri, but either had less than 10, or had seen less than two
poem-triggered Sayori dreams.</span></p></li>
<li><p>The Good Ending: <span class="spoiler">MC remembers Sayori before it's too late. He goes to her house and, with his awareness this high, he's able to
hear you speak through dialog options. You tell him your plan to revive Sayori by restoring her character file. It works, and everyone confronts Monika.
You kill Monika (see Perfect Ending if you choose not to), and MC and the three remaining girls have reasonable prospects for the future: since you started a new game, Yuri's insanity isn't as
exaggerated as it was by the end of Act 2, and although Sayori's depression is still at its worst, her friends are there to comfort her, and now that she
knows it's partly the result of tampering, she promises not to kill herself again.</span></p></li>
<li><p>The Perfect Ending: <span class="spoiler">Same as the Good Ending, except you forgive Monika after she explains what she went through (this doesn't
require any more flags, you just make the choice). Monika is able to undo what she did to the other girls, and everyone lives happily ever
after.</span></p></li>
<li><p>The Evil Ending: <span class="spoiler">MC joins Monika, and the two of them live happily ever after, god knowing what happens to Natsuki and Yuri.
Why would you care when you think they're not real? This ending is the only one that doesn't depend on awareness flags at all. You simply have to write the
first two poems for Monika ("abstract" followed by "imprisonment").</span></p></li>
</ol>
