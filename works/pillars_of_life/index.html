TITLE Pillars Of Life: Index
TEMPLATE DEFAULT

<p>This one is a pure fantasy novel that I originally envisioned many, many years ago (back when I was garbage at storytelling). It has the following traits:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The medieval tech level typical of fantasy stories (of which I'm ashamed), but at least it has a unique geology.</p></li>
<li><p>A magic system that I realize isn't great, but at least it's original.</p></li>
<li><p>An unfortunate case of black-and-white morality, but least the villains have a motive rather than being <a href="/fiction/strawman_chaotic_evil">Strawman Chaotic Evil</a> (albeit a slightly flimsy one).</p></li>
<li><p>A less-than-super-interesting protagonist, but at least he understands the basics of how to have an arc.</p></li>
<li><p>I <i>know</i> the guards' cruelty is overdone and it damages the story. There is no need to message me with that criticism. I just don't consider it feasible to go back and change it now. I'm better off working on new projects.</p></li>
