The Bright Raincloud
</p><p>
There once was a Raincloud that sent no rain,<br>
Instead it cast sunlight on the earth;<br>
Though the storm urged it to follow, the sun was dark and the wind was cold,<br>
The Raincloud held it in and gave away the rays of light it did not have.
</p><p>
It absorbed the few moments of sun each morning,<br>
Before the storm began for the day;<br>
It would shine these rays until evening,<br>
Holding in the rain.
</p><p>
The workers below were oblivious,<br>
Its rays they took for granted;<br>
Blind to the rain inside,<br>
Not once did they assist.
</p><p>
The storm grew fiercer and the rain inside the Raincloud heavier,<br>
Yet it stayed strong and cared for those below;<br>
It awaited the sun,<br>
Asking only a moment's sustenance.
</p><p>
But one day the sun never rose.
</p><p>
The Raincloud waited patiently,<br>
Enduring,<br>
Shivering,<br>
Faltering,<br>
All through the day and night,<br>
Shining its last ray.
</p><p>
The day after that, the sun never rose.
</p><p>
At last The Bright Raincloud was no more,<br>
and the workers below were destroyed by the storm.
