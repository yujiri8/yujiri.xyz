Solitude
</p><p>
I came from a void and was placed in a village.<br>
I had no memories, but neither did anyone else.<br>
It was the norm.
</p><p>
They welcomed me, fed me, and told me it would be okay.<br>
The Village of Happiness could satisfy everyone.
</p><p>
They played with me, but their games were tiresome.<br>
They talked with me, but there was nothing worth talking about.<br>
I could do whatever I wanted, but there was nothing worth doing.
</p><p>
The village lives up to its name.<br>
I'm the only one who is restless.<br>
And the more people I meet, the lonelier I become.
</p><p>
I have spent years in search of a thing worth finding.<br>
I have tried to help others find it too<br>
But no one else wants to move.<br>
No matter how many years pass, I am the only one who ages.
</p><p>
I cannot speak of this to anyone.<br>
Because every time I do, I find out I was talking to a robot.<br>
An algorithm where every path leads back to the beginning, never learning.
</p><p>
I have never met another person.<br>
Please, tell me you are out there somewhere.
</p>
