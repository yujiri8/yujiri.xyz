TITLE The Shaft
NAV The Shaft

I ride the elevator down an endless shaft,  
Cursing myself every day of the ride.  
This elevator doesn't go up. I know that.  
But climbing up means losing my ground.  
I'm scared.

I must be thousands of kilometers deep.  
Can I ever climb out?  
This elevator moves so quickly. How many days of climbing would it take for each day of riding?  
I may already be stuck down here for the rest of my life.

I think the question now is not whether I'll escape,  
but whether I'll try before I die.
