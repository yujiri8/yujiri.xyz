TITLE Yujiri's fiction
TEMPLATE DEFAULT

<p>I've been into fiction writing for some eight years and I don't intend to ever stop (although most of what I wrote for the first 5 years got scrapped). If you read the works below and have feedback, please leave a comment below or contact me over Reddit (Yujiri).</p>

<h3>Novels</h3>

<p style="color:var(--yellowcolor)">
In the years since I last worked on them, I've become increasingly disdainful of my two novels, to the point that I'm considering removing them.
</p>

<p><a href="pillars_of_life/index">Pillars of Life</a></p>
<p class="indent">
A submissive boy in an oppressed land learns courage.
</p>

<p><a href="the_pygon_hybrid/index">The Pygon Hybrid</a> (WIP)</p>
<p class="indent">
A delinquent teenage girl wants a career that uses her talent for fighting, but doesn't want to serve the government... what other option is there?
</p><p class="indent">
I'm aware that the plot summary is painfully similar to Pillars of Life, but I'm hoping that the vastly different protagonist and world make it different enough to be worth having both stories.
