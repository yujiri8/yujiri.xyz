I spend the entire six-hour ride to the other side of the metropolis for our next operation learning about the software behind the scenes in companions - about file hierarchies, processes, sockets, kernels, bytes, and a bunch of other concepts I've never heard of. Ian says all this stuff is obfuscated from the average user specifically to make it impossible to master the
Telgon node independently. Software developers as trained in the government academies are actually learning a sort of proxy language that allows them to write useful code still without really understanding how companions work.</p><p>
I start feeling halfway through that I'm overloaded and I need to take a break and absorb all this, but I made myself a promise. I'm going to do the impossible. I can't do that if I can't even study for more than a few hours at a time.</p><p>
<!--Ian mentions that .-->
We get off at a port near another hub. We're here to take out police training instructors during session. The others all agreed that it would be the most effective way to sway people at the same time as picking off enemies, since meeting us in person will have a humanizing effect on the way the cadets see us. It also gives us a chance to grab Pygon blades so we can arm
recruits who aren't coming from cadethood.</p><p>
Thale clears his throat. "Everyone, let's... please be more careful this time. We can't let last time happen again."</p><p>
"I'm ready as hell," Lucy says. "The sooner we kill them, the safer every innocent person in the metropolis will be."</p><p>
Zak says, "Just please, if one of us is going to die, don't try to protect me."</p><p>
"I won't sacrifice strategy for it," Thale says, "but that goes both ways."</p><p>
"But you're more powerful," Zak says. Thale gives a defeated sigh.</p><p>
It's weird. Both of them seem to actually <i>want</i> to be the one to die if it happens. And I think they're both telling the truth. Is this what following their idea of morality does to you? Even though I kind of understand the logical reason for it from talking to Zak, it still seems really bizarre to me to be more loyal to that than to self-preservation.</p><p>
I can't decide what I think of it either. I abhor the thought of sacrificing myself to save someone else. But I can't really say it's <i>weak</i>, and that's pretty much my only value, isn't it?</p><p>
Ian says this time he's also hacked into the companions of nearby citizens, so he'll see if one of the off-the-grid patrol groups comes looking for us. It still wouldn't entirely surprise me if somehow the government one-ups us a third time in a row, but it's at least more reassuring than not having a patch for the last weakness that got exploited.</p><p>
We walk into the academy building where the cadet are trained. There are two batches in session right now. I ask, "So are we splitting up again? It's safer if we get done with this sooner, but we also don't want to spread so thin that we risk losing another person even if we don't get ambushed."</p><p>
"I really want to all stay togther," Thale says. "Please, I can't lose another one of you."</p><p>
"We have to put the cause above our personal fears," Zak says.</p><p>
Lucy says, "I'm sure we'll be fine in two groups. Send one of us with each kid and there should be no way we lose to a single soldier. Besides, we need to kill as many of them as we can as fast as we can if we're going to win this war."</p><p>
"Well... I just..." Thale sighs. "You're right. I should do the right thing instead of what I want to do. Alright. Who wants who?"</p><p>
I shrug. I've spent more bonding time with Thale, but that's an argument in both directions. Honestly I want to be with Zak. But I've gotta let strategy take the front seat.</p><p>
Lucy says to Thale, "Since you're more worried about it, I'd suggest sending Zak with you."</p><p>
Thale and Zak both agree. We split ways. <!--and Ian hacks the doors of the rooms we're not hitting to make sure the other instructors won't be a problem if they overhear us.--><!-- for the two batches of cadets that are farthest along.--></p><p>
Lucy absolutely demolishes the door with power attacks in a few seconds. "Ready to die?" she says as we walk in the room, me behind her.</p><p>
The instructor of the classroom draws his blades. "What the f- rebels! Cadets, this is your chance to help your -"</p><p>
"To try thinking for yourself!" I shout over the instructor. "You've all heard the truth, right? This is your chance to get revenge against the government that's been oppressing you and lying to you. You can join the revolution, or you can just walk away after this and follow your own path, but there's no reason to stick your neck out to defend the government."</p><p>
I survey the expressions of the cadets. They're very diverse. I can see a least a few that look like they'd be helping the instructor if they were sure that was the winning side. I can also see several of them moving toward our side of the room. None of them speak.</p><p>
"Attack them!" the instructor says, clearly panicked that the cadets will end up helping us. "Help me!"</p><p>
"Pathetic," Lucy says. "You expect your students to attack before you? Goes to show how self-centered you really are. Telra can we kill him now?"</p><p>
Wait, what? Why is she entrusting the decision to me? Regardless, I nod and we move toward the instructor.</p><p>
The instructor yells at the cadets to help him some more as we gang up. None of them end up joining the fight, and we kill the one enemy with relative ease.</p><p>
Lucy stabs him repeatedly once he's on the ground and sends blood everywhere. "Take that you fucking bastard! You monsters!"</p><p>
"Lucy, careful!" I say instinctively. "We're here to sway people. You're making us look bloodthirsty or something."</p><p>
Lucy turns around to the cadets. "They're the goddamn bloodthirsty ones! They're the ones who kill people for refusing to follow their bullshit laws!"</p><p>
I turn to the cadets as well. "Lucy's daughter was murdered by the government." I leave implied, "You'll have to give her some slack." The reason we aren't bothering with any philosophical finesse and arguments about the illegitimacy of the government's contrpl over the economy is because Ian already covered that angle in his broadcast, but I still think it's important to not come off the way Lucy is. I mean, our target audience is probably people who are somewhere between normies and the rest of the gang.</p><p>
"And she was a better person than any of you," Lucy says.</p><p>
"It's true," I say. "She was brave, altruistic, and gave her life to save our Telgon hacker." I want to drive home the point that we rebels are heroic people despite it seeming like we started the violence.</p><p>
Finally, at long last, one of the cadets finds words. She says, "Um... can we go? Or do you want something with us?"</p><p>
"I already answered that," I say, "if you were paying attention."</p><p>
Now it's Lucy's turn to cover for me when I place having fun over a positive impact. "Yes, yes, you can go. But you shouldn't. You should help us. And we're taking your blades if you walk out."</p><p>
The girl who spoke drops her blades on the ground and sprints out. What a coward. I half-consider nicking her as she runs past, but I know better than to completely destroy what we're trying to do here.</p><p>
Most of the cadets follow her, leaving only three. One boy who sounds like Zak asks, "How can we help? I want to... but... I'm not strong enough to fight police..."</p><p>
I look at Lucy. "You know, it's probably safe to trust him. There's no way he was in contact with the government before this and they gave him the mission to infiltrate us."</p><p>
"I don't think so," Lucy says. "Even if he wasn't given the mission, he could be like Ashley trying to find out where our base is so he can ditch us and betray for a reward. It'd be an easy way to completely get rid of the rebellion."</p><p>
"I guess so." I suppose someone could exist with Ashley's ideology but enough courage to do something like that. "Sorry," I say to the boy. "You can't come with us because we have to worry so much about infiltrators, but you can still help. You keep your blades, and maybe the three of you can work together to pick off individual police." I
look at the other two remaining cadets - one boy and one girl.</p><p>
"I think we can do it," the girl says, looking at the two boys. The synthesis of fear and ambition in their voices isn't quite like anything I've heard. It's not like Brev's wingmates, who were cursing the stupidity of rebellion and only going along with it out of peer pressure, and it's not like Zak before the first operation, where he sounded more prepared.</p><p>
The girl continues. "Three of us should be a match for one of them, right?"</p><p>
The second boy says, "We can keep training and getting stronger if we're not ready to fight yet."</p><p>
Lucy says, "You can also assassinate police when they're off-duty. Just make sure you all really trust each other before you stake everything on it. Also, remember to turn off your companions whenever you're doing something illegal. I can't overstress how important that is."</p><p>
The first boy says, "Oh god, I can't believe this is happening. It was only this afternoon when we got Ian's message. It feels like the whole world has turned upside-down in a few hours. But I know which side I wanna stand for."</p><p>
"Good luck," I say, trying to echo Kelly's words. "If you find a way to prove for certain we can trust you, we can team up. Ian will be able to reach you through your companions."</p><p>
Lucy and I pick up as many extra blades as we can carry, and we begin to head back to the turboline car. Thale and Zak have been successful as well. It seems like everything is going good.</p><p>
<!--"So are we going to?" I ask. "I'm up for it."</p><p>
"It's not a matter of whether we're up for it," Lucy says. "We have to."</p><p>-->
Ian contacts us. "We need to get outta here! They found us!"</p><p>
"What the <i>fuck</i>!" I say as we all drop the extra blades and bolt back to the turboline car. This <i>can't</i> be real!</p><p>
"One of their hackers noticed I was interfering with the footage upload from the companions of everyone here. They turned off the turboline and they're sending in all available troops. We need to get far away from here ASAP."</p><p>
Oh fuck, this is so bullshit. We meet Ian near the disabled turboline car and he starts running with us.</p><p>
"Shit," Ian says. "It's no use, they're tracking us through bystanders' companion footage! I have to do this..." He stops and sits down, staring into his companion and closing his eyes.</p><p>
We draw our blades and surround him. "Oh for fuck's sake!" I say. "It's going to be just like last time! We're gonna have to protect Ian and -"</p><p>
Zak shouts, "Just let me be the one this time! If someone has to stand between -"</p><p>
"Don't even go there!" Thale says. "The moment we accept defeat is the moment it happens!"</p><p>
But we luck out. Ian stands up just a few seconds later and says, "That did it! I've broken all companions in the metropolis."</p><p>
"You <i>what</i>?" Thale says as we collapse our blades and continue running.</p><p>
I'm initially shocked too, but I smile. If that's what it takes to get us out of this situation, I'm impressed that Ian is willing to do it.</p><p>
"All normal people's companions, that is," Ian says. "Obviously ours and the government hackers' are fine. Probably their servers too. But at least they can't see everything that happens everywhere."</p><p>
"So where are we going?" I ask. "We still need a place to stop and we can't get to our old hideout without the turboline."</p><p>
"For now," Ian says, "we just gotta get far away from here. When we think it's safe we'll stop at the house of an off-duty cop who lives alone. I'll use my offline copy of the database to find one."</p><p>
"Nice," Lucy says. "We can pick off another enemy and find ourselves a place at the same time."</p>
<br><p>
We flee for hours. Night falls, and we flee a few more hours. Eventually we arrive at a house in a more or less secluded area. Ian hacks open the lock in a split second.</p><p>
We're greeted immediately on entry by the soldier who lives here. She's sitting on a couch trying to take apart her companion with a screwdriver. She probably thinks it shut off because the battery got dislodged or something.</p><p>
She looks up. "Hey, what the hell are -" Her eyes land on our blades. She drops her companion. "Fuck! Don't kill me!"</p><p>
Lucy rushes toward her. "Then you shouldn't have killed Kelly!" In seconds, Lucy kills and thoroughly dismembers the woman. Jeez.</p><p>
"I guess you wanted the Pygon growth all for yourself," I say.</p><p>
Lucy gives me an angry look, but says nothing.</p><p>
"Come to think of it," I add, "since the Pygon node grows from inflicting pain, can you get more growth out of torturing someone?"</p><p>
"No," Ian says, "and fortunately so. The government did a lot of research on both nodes near the beginning of their reign. It seemed like inflicting pain on a defenseless person didn't count."</p><p>
"Makes me wonder if Ashley counted during the sparring match," I mutter to myself.</p><p>
<!--Ian picks up the dead officer's companion. "This will "</p><p>
"Ian," Lucy says, "none of us give a shit." -->Lucy sits down. "We need to plan our next move. We have a lot more soldiers to kill before we can call this a victory."</p><p>
Ian says, "Well, we need to keep picking them off in small groups, and we need to continue to sway as many people as possible. I think it's safe to spend the night here though, since we're reasonably far away from the site of our last attack and they don't have any of their surveilance tools anymore."</p><p>
Thale says, "I'm going to a room that doesn't have <i>that</i> in it." He walks out, reminding me of the rather disgusting sight on the couch.</p><p>
"<i>'That'</i>," Lucy says, "is a reminder of what the government did to our daughter... and what we must do to them. I'm staying in this room."</p><p>
I follow Thale. I ask him in a lowered voice, "Has Lucy always been like this?"</p><p>
Thale's face turns grim. He beckons for me to follow him further into the house.</p><p>
"No," he says. "Ever since Kelly died she lost her personality. It makes me very sad. Not that I expect her to go back to making jokes so soon, but... And not that the government doesn't deserve to be hated, but... she doesn't seem to be able to think about anything else."</p><p>
"Well, anger does give you motivation."</p><p>
"Yes, but it's not like every soldier is personally responsible for murdering Kelly. We already took revenge, and she refuses to be satisfied. She said she was killing that woman back there for killing Kelly."</p><p>
"So you're worried she'll place revenge over strategy at some point?"</p><p>
As soon as I say it, I remember what happened when we were arguing with the instructor in class before we killed him. Was that why she entrusted the decision of whether to attack yet to me? Because she knew her anger was impairing her judgement? Again, it's not at all the choice I would have made, but I find myself not feeling the disdain for it that I normally do when I see
people voluntarily give up agency.</p><p>
"Not even that really," Thale says, "I just feel bad for her. Not being able to think about anything but anger... anger is painful."</p><p>
"Is it?" I say. I've felt lots of anger before and I never really thought of it as a form of suffering.</p><p>
"At least when you can't take it out, it is. It's just like sorrow. No one wants to feel it, but most people can't help it at least sometimes because they care. It's natural to feel sad or angry when the world isn't the way you wish it was. And then there are times when someone chooses to focus on their suffering, making it worse than it has to be.
That's what Lucy is doing. She tells herself it's disrespectful to not be angry all the time now. It just hurts me to see my wife like this. And she won't even talk to me about it. I tried on the turboline ride here. She's taken all the joy out of life for herself and she won't let anyone comfort her."</p><p>
"So Lucy is strong," I say. "She's accepting suffering to respect what she believes deserves to be respected."</p><p>
As I say it, I realize that that's kind of the root of my ideology. I gave up what would have been a profitable career and a comfortable life to rebel against all odds and reason, simply because I didn't want to live a life of submission. Accepting suffering or danger for the sake for the sake of something that serves no purpose other than itself.</p><p>
Actually, I notice that I never really grieved for Brev and his wingmates, even though I respected them. I was upset in the moment because my power fantasy was ruined, but after I got out and realized I'd have a second chance, I completely forgot about it. Was that because I was too weak to let myself feel bad for what <i>was</i> my fault?</p><p>
"Yes," Thale says, "but it's misguided. I don't fully understand the relationship between anger and sorrow and what causes some people to feel one over the other, but Lucy is choosing anger on purpose even when the people she's mad at aren't responsible for what she's mad at them for. She thinks being sad would be weak or something, perhaps because it would let us comfort her.
That's not right. It's not what Kelly would want anyway."</p><p>
Ian comes in with food. "Here you two are. You must both be hungry."</p><p>
"Thanks again," Thale says. "I don't know where we'd be without you."</p><p>
"Neither do I," Ian says as he walks away.</p><p>
I giggle slightly at Ian's words, but I notice that Thale's fists are clenched. "... Thale? He was making a joke, just like he's done before."</p><p>
"He's so insensitive! Does he not realize what all of us are going through? Just because it's been one day doesn't mean we've stopped grieving!"</p><p>
"Well, to be fair," I say, "what he said was literally true. He <i>is</i> the only one of us who's actually irreplaceable."</p><p>
Thale sighs. "That doesn't excuse his behavior. Also, no, it's not literally true. We all know where we'd be without him."</p><p>
"True," I say. "Should we go back now?"</p><p>
"Yeah. Telra, I just want you to know that I appreciate having your perspective on these things."</p><p>
"Wait, what? You called me an asshole in our first real conversation and you think I'm a terrible person."</p><p>
Thale smiles slightly. "I don't think you're a terrible person. I think you're a good person with the potential to be a lot better."</p><p>
I stop in my tracks, shocked by Thale's words. He just keeps on going. Eventually I catch up with him and rejoin everyone else. Thankfully they've moved out of the room with the dead body, even Lucy.</p><p>
"Zak," Thale says while we're all eating. "I wanted to ask you something. Back there when we were getting ready to defend Ian, you seemed more than just ready to die. You seemed eager."</p><p>
Zak looks away. "I just don't want to have to live through anyone else dying. It's really for my own sake."</p><p>
Thale shakes his head. "No, it's more than that. You blame yourself for Kelly's death, don't you?"</p><p>
Zak puts down his fork and suddenly shouts. "Of course I do! Don't you? Who can you blame, if not me?"</p><p>
Lucy gets up and shouts as well. "How about blaming the enemy? They're the only monsters here! Beating yourself up for their crimes isn't going to help bring them to justice!"</p><p>
"What if I've committed crimes too?" Zak says. "I can't give myself a free pardon just because there's someone worse out there!"</p><p>
"But Zak," Thale says, "you're still a good person! You're still risking your life in a fight against tyranny! Doesn't that far outweigh whatever flaws you have?"</p><p>
"No, it doesn't! I was raised to do this from my first breath. I've never really even known temptation. When I had to be brave, I had all of you right beside me. It almost would have been harder to <i>not</i> be brave. The only real trial I've ever faced was the fight where Kelly died, and I fucked it up because I was only thinking about myself!"</p><p>
"Hold on," Ian says, "think about this. By the time you die you'll probably have done more for the forces of good than 99% of people in this world. Also, it's worth keeping in mind that if you hadn't been there, Telra probably would have died too."</p><p>
"That doesn't make me a good person though," Zak says, looking down. After a minute, he does finally go back to eating.
</p><p>
I decide to start a conversation. "Does it seem weird to anyone else that there are so many willing government soldiers?"
</p><p>
When they look at me for an explanation, I continue. "Like how is it that so many people are willing to undergo so much pain for something with no morality or ambition as motivating factors?"
</p><p>
Lucy is the first to answer. "It's cause being a guard is passive job. When you're a cop, all you have to do is stand around somewhere and do nothing most of the time. They can literally play video games during their job. I did. It's the most pathetic way of pretending you're worth something to society."
</p><p>
I finish my last bite. "You know, somehow in all my time in training I never even thought about that. But still, it baffles me that they're willing to go through so much for it. Even a normal job is only a few hours of work a day."
</p><p>
"Well," Zak says, "it's not <i>that</i> painful. With protection on during sparring matches, and you're not required to keep going through it after you graduate and get assigned."
</p><p>
Thale adds, "I think you just underestimate people. They may not care about it as much as you do, but I think it's human nature to enjoy the feeling of pride from knowing you can endure such things."
</p><p>
They can't be right. The people I hate can't share a part of me that I value so much. There must be something to it I don't understand. I discontinue the conversation because I don't want to hear this anymore.
</p><p>
Ian comes back from clearing his plate. "Telra. While we're here, you should try out your Telgon abilities. With everything you've learned about companions, you should be able to go into digital mode now."
</p><p>
I sit down on the couch and focus on my companion. To my surprise, it happens easily.
</p><p>
My normal senses disappear. I can 'see' memory, but I don't know where I am or what it means. I assume I'm looking at the RAM for some program.
</p><p>
I browse around it. I see a lot of bytes, some with recognizable patterns, but I don't know how to interpret any of them.
</p><p>
I move into the hard drive. I have the idea to find a text file somewhere and see if I can read it, but I don't know how to tell what file I'm in or where one file ends and another begins, and even if I did I don't think I'd know which byte was which character. I don't have the ASCII table memorized or anything.
</p><p>
I come out, and my normal senses return. It's kind of -
</p><p>
"You did it!" Ian says. "That's great! You're gonna be a great hacker in no time!"
</p><p>
"I couldn't read anything..." I say.
</p><p>
"Oh don't worry, that's normal at first. With some experience your node learns to automatically convert binary data to a readable format. It's good that you were able to go in though."
