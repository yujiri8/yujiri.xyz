<p>
The next thing I know I'm on the couch with the feeling that I've just woken up. I glance around.</p><p>
Sure enough, nobody else is here. I check my companion.</p><p>
Apparently I slept through the night... it's noon now. Dang. Was I that tired?</p><p>
"Ian?" I call. "Anyone?"</p><p>
Ian comes in. "Yeah, the Telgon node costs wakefulness, just like the Pygon node costs physical energy. It's normal to sleep a long time after your first digitization."</p><p>
"So what have I missed?"</p><p>
"Not much. The others stole another medical droid from the nearest hub, which are mostly unguarded now that the government sent almost all their forces to the site of our last attack. I reprogrammed it to be like the one we had at our old base."</p><p>
I frown. I would have really wanted to come with them on that mission, even if they didn't end up doing any fighting. "So what's our plan? I feel like the hub thing is getting really predictable."</p><p>
"Well," Ian says, "before I took down the grid they were sending almost everyone to that area. Now that they can't communicate it should keep the brunt of their force busy for a pretty long time."</p><p>
"But surely they didn't leave their hubs in the rest of the metropolis unguarded." I'm actually hoping they didn't, because I want to fight.</p><p>
"We can't know. But the others did slip in and nab a medical droid, so it's likely that if they didn't the guards are just concentrated in one area to prevent us from picking them off. In which case we shouldn't try to fight them - four or so guards at once is likely to mean the death of at least one of you."</p><p>
I frown again. I can't keep my Pygon node from losing strength if I don't fight!</p><p>
I act normal. "Are we just gonna stop fighting for a while and try to recruit more people while we have the opportunity?"</p><p>
"Probably. It's a great opportunity for you to strengthen your Telgon node. The more people you teach what I taught you about companions, the stronger it'll get."</p><p>
"Okay," I say, "but we still have to be careful about people turning us in. We can't really relocate quickly without the turboline."</p><p>
Ian taps the side of his head and smirks. "True, but people also can't record us without their companions."</p><p>
After some food, we head out to the street. Ian and I split up. We're both going to teach as many people as possible. Zak is with me; apparently Ian taught Thale and Lucy to boost his own node already but he didn't teach Kelly and Zak because he hadn't given up on one of them becoming his apprentice and he didn't want to waste the fuel before their nodes were catalyzed.</p><p>
Zak and I head a few grid-blocks away from the place we were staying so it's not easy for people to find us if they want to report us. We gather a dozen people or so in a group on the street. All of them claim to be on our side, although I'm sure a lot of them are lying and there's no way to tell.</p><p>
One of the civilians says, "I have a question before we start. Do you rebels know how our companions got broken? Apparently it happened to everyone."</p><p>
Zak and I share a glance. What do we tell them? I really don't want to tell them we rebels did this, but if we tell them the government did it, they'll probably find out the truth eventually and it might do even more damage. I also don't have a proposed motive in mind. These people were the government's surveilance system, after all.</p><p>
Zak says, "the government broke them all so we couldn't see where their forces were."</p><p>
Well, here we go. I hope Zak knows what he's doing.</p><p>
The same man gives him a skeptical squint and says, "But surely having our companions online helped them more than it helped you. Especially since if what Ian said is true, there are several government hackers and now that the conflict is in full there's no way he alone can outhack all of them."</p><p>
I think about telling them that Ian actually <i>can</i> outhack all of them because of the massive power boost he got from sending the broadcast, but I didn't watch the broadcast, so I don't know if these people know how that works. I decide not to take the risk.</p><p>
A woman who seems to be the man's wife adds, "And couldn't they just send off-the-grid squads by word of mouth?"</p><p>
Zak is visibly blushing. He really got us into a fix.</p><p>
"In fact," the woman adds, "isn't that what happened at the academy battle where Kelly died?"</p><p>
Oh shit. That's public knowledge?</p><p>
Zak screams, "You don't know what you're talking about!" He says it so loudly that my ears hurt. Everyone pauses for a minute.</p><p>
It's up to me to save this situation. I clear my throat. "Look, okay, Zak lied." (I use his name deliberately for the humanization factor.) "Our own hacker broke the companions because the government found us and it was the only way to stop them from tracking us.
If we hadn't done that, the rebellion would have failed and you all would have lived in oppression for the rest of your lives. He lied for the same reason - to improve public perception of our cause so more people would join and we could free the world more easily."</p><p>
Zak is looking at me like I just saved his life. I can tell from the audience's expressions that I also did a decent job on their impression. Damn, how am I better at making this moralistic rebel case than the actual moralistic rebels are?</p><p>
The original man says, "How can we trust someone who lies to the people they claim to be freeing?"</p><p>
Damn! He makes it sound all bad.</p><p>
Zak jumps back in. "And which group told you the bigger lie? And which one did it to maintain power over you rather than to eventually help?"</p><p>
The man says, "But which group actually destroyed my personal property? That seems a step above lying to me, no matter how you look at it."</p><p>
Zak says, "The government takes a huge portion of your income as taxes. Sure, they claim it's for the common good - the same thing we claim. The only difference is that if we win, we'll fix your companion and not interfere with your life after that, and if they win you continue to be their subject."</p><p>
The woman says, "Ian's broadcast didn't prove what he claimed about the fraudulent elections, and we have no evidence at all that you're going to be any different if you take over. But this is all beside the point. I thought you brought us out here to teach us stuff, not argue about the politics of a war we're not involved in."</p><p>
She's right. I'm not exactly happy with the impression we made by lying and Zak's outburst, but it's not like most of these people are probably ever going to help either side anyway. The point of this was to grow my Telgon node. I start lecturing.</p><p>
Zak is obviously uncomfortable having the conversation shut down after he made those two blunders, but he does his best to listen and absorb what I'm saying.</p><p>
After one hour, everyone but an old couple has gotten bored and left. I'm incredibly bored myself. If it weren't for Zak here to hold me accountable I probably would have left by now to go do something more fun.</p><p>
I pause, hoping it will give the two remaining people the impression that I'm out of stuff to say and they'll leave too giving Zak the impression that I did my best. But then I catch myself - am I really letting Zak's unspoken psychological pressure control me? What the hell!</p><p>
"That's all for now," I say when the two remaining people keep looking at me expectantly. I ignore Zak's confused look and start to walk away.</p><p>
The woman comes after me. "Wait! We're not done! We want to know more! We want to help you and Ian hack!"</p><p>
I halt and look back. The woman's voice is surprisingly confident and insistent.</p><p>
Her husband adds, "I've got a background in electronics so I might be more useful than an average non-Pygon recruit."</p><p>
I feel this really strong urge to trust them. Just like I did with the cadets. I just hate the thought of leaving behind someone who shows so much of me.</p><p>
Zak starts to say the normal line about how we can't trust people due to infiltration, but I raise my hand to stop him. "We have to leave the area soon, but maybe... maybe I can fix your companions, and then we can continue over those. Ian should know how to make sure you can't trace the traffic if you turn out to be infiltrators."</p><p>
I don't know what Ian did to them, I realize. But I'm determined to do this. I'm not leaving them behind. I take one of the companions and digitize into it.</p><p>
Whoa... I think that lesson I gave made a huge difference. Data patterns already look so much more recognizable. Still, it's dark in here, which I guess its because it's off. It's weird - I'm describing it as dark, but that term doesn't really apply to a world without vision. I can see just the same. Maybe my mind just goes to that word to describe the alien feeling
because it's an obvious metaphor for what it would be like inside an off computer.</p><p>
I pinpoint the locations of some of the files on the hard drive that Ian taught me are used during the boot process. I turn it on, and I see some being loaded into memory... then it starts undoing everything and goes dark again.</p><p>
Hm... I need to find out what code in what file is causing that. But Ian didn't teach me the boot process in that much detail. I'm in over my head here.</p><p>
I come out of digitization mode. "I don't know how to do this... I don't know what Ian's exploit was or have the knowledge to pinpoint why it's crashing."</p><p>
"Well you're gonna <i>do</i> it," the woman says, "cause I'm not getting left out of this revolution."</p><p>
I admire her even more for this. "Don't worry, yes, I am. I just... have no idea how..."</p><p>
Zak says, "Why not just call Ian for help? I'm sure he can spare a minute to tell you what to do."</p><p>
"I don't wanna. I'm gonna solve this on my own."</p><p>
I'm surprised at myself somewhat. At first I saw being forced to train the Telgon node as a burden that would ruin my life. And I still hate it. But now I'm into this and I'm not giving up. It's a matter of pride, just like refusing to get the police against Brev and my fight with Zak.</p><p>
"Got it! I don't need to trace the cause of the shutdown. I have a companion with working system files right here to compare it too." I hold up my own. "I just need to find the difference."</p><p>
I redigitize. It takes a few minutes to compare megabytes of data, but I find the corrupted file. There's just a few bytes in one of the essential files that are different. I have no idea what the significance of those bytes is, but I don't need to. I copy over the data from mine and try to boot the companion.</p><p>
I come out of digitization mode to save my wakefulness and so I have fingers to cross. It... works! The splash image comes up followed by the home screen in a few seconds.</p><p>
The rush of pride is so strong. I haven't felt this good since... since I picked up my blades just before Brev and I got ambushed. Maybe I'll end up enjoying being a Telgon hacker after all. I'd still much rather be outfighting cops sword-to-sword, but maybe this isn't all bad.</p><p>
"Whoa..." the woman says. "You did it!"</p><p>
"I suppose I am pretty badass," I say, deliberately echoing Ian's words the first time I met him.</p><p>
I fix the other companion, and then we head back to the place.</p><p>
Zak speaks along the way, "You did amazingly well back there. Covered my mistakes <i>and</i> got us two recruits."</p><p>
I shrug. "Not like it was that hard. I just said what came to mind and solved a basic puzzle."</p><p>
"You have a lot of potential, you know? Someday you'll be a great hero. Maybe the greatest of us."</p><p>
I squint. "Zak? What are you saying?"</p><p>
"I just want you to realize that you can be more that what you started out as. I know you tried to walk away becuase you didn't want to do this Telgon stuff any more than you had to. But if you really want to be the strongest person you can be - and I know you do - then you'll end up choosing the moral path. Because that's the real hardest path."</p><p>
I think about rolling my eyes at Zak for trying to convert me like Thale always is, but in light of what I was thinking when Thale and I talked about Lucy, I'm starting to think he might be right. Isn't it undeniable that having to care about normies too would be harder?</p><p>
No, I don't want to go there! I don't want to regret torturing Ashley and assaulting the clerk! No, Zak is wrong. Being a moralist isn't stronger. It's what society wants. The others are just me mixed with them.</p><p>
I end up saying, "But you want me to be a hacker instead of being on the frontline! That's not the strongest way to be! I'd have been a coward to accept this vouluntarily!"</p><p>
"Maybe if you hate it so much, then the stronger thing is to accept what serves your cause instead of your personal enjoyment."</p><p>
My fists clench at the thought. I shout, "You think courage is about personal enjoyment? No wonder you don't give yourself any credit! That must be why you feel the need to take out your self-hatred on me by trashing my virtues!"</p><p>
Zak says nothing in response. His face doesn't react either. I would have thought he'd be at least a little affected by me striking there. Despite him thinking so highly of me, he doesn't seem to care what I think of him.</p><p>
When we get back to the place, Zak speaks up. "I just realized... Why did we come here? The plan was to spend the day recruiting. And it's not like we need to go back to base to report."</p><p>
Shit. I totally forgot it wasn't a one-time thing. I sigh heavily and look down. How am I going to win this?</p><p>
"Look, it's absurd to expect me to spend the whole day rehashing the same explanations."</p><p>
Zak responds immediately. "That's bullshit and you know it. You spent <i>one hour</i> teaching, and right now, this is the most effective way to help the cause and repay the people who saved your life in the first place."</p><p>
Damn! I forgot about that card. I hope the others don't start playing it on me.</p><p>
"I won't let my Pygon node drain!" I yell. "Just because I lost a fight doesn't give you the right to ruin my life! The plan was for me to train both nodes, not to forsake my talent for what we already have an expert in!"</p><p>
But even as I say it I know that I'm making up bullshit in so many ways. Not only is it my own principles that losing a duel means you have to do the agreement no matter what, but the "plan for me to train both nodes" was entirely my devising after the fact, and we all know that no single hacker can take on the entire government force.</p><p>
Zak looks at me in a way that tells me he sees all of those ways. "It's not like we <i>can</i> go pick off cops safely anyway. I think the two of us could take one, but we can't see everthing happening everywhere like we could before and they're probably sticking in groups."</p><p>
"Then let's get everyone together and go kill some," I say.</p><p>
"You know why that's a bad idea." Zak sounds so forceful even when he's shorter than me.</p><p>
"Then fight me right now! It'll make both of our Pygon nodes stronger. What else was the medical droid for?"</p><p>
"The medical droid was in case we get into a fight on accident and so we can take it with us when it's time for us to relocate and get back to fighting. Right now, I believe the most effective way to fight the enemy even without the Telgon growth factor is to try to convert people. So that's what I'm going to do. You can either do the same or be a fucking traitor."</p><p>
Fuck it! What do I do? I can't just spend the entire day teaching civilians!</p><p>
I stand indecisive for several seconds. Thankfully, Zak doesn't continue to look at me; he walks out.</p><p>
Wait. Did he just let me out of this? If he's gone, I could go wherever I want and no one would know. I could tell them I went to recruit.</p><p>
Hm... but again, I don't really have anything else to do. It's not like I can go fight police on my own. I'd almost certainly be killed.</p><p>
Ugh, dammit. I might as well go teach people. Maybe I can offer to train them in Pygon instead.</p><p>
Hey... now that's a nice idea. We do need Pygon recruits at least as badly as Telgon recruits anyway. But I don't have blades to train them with.</p><p>
Go to the academy and steal some? Why not. Here I go. I'll be able to report to the others that I tried to recruit people without even lying, and my Telgon node will still have gained strength. Even if the others find out what I did, it'll be hard for them to argue with my results getting two people to join us as hackers already.</p>
<br><p>
I'm a little on edge walking through the empty academy (all the teachers and students are absent due to the circumstances). It gets really strong when I approach the door to one of the training rooms. It's just like last time. I can see it so vividly.</p><p>
But remember, fear is what makes me brave. I swallow and destroy the door with power attacks.</p><p>
I pick up a few extra pairs of blades, and head -</p><p>
My companion rings. It's a call from Ian.</p><p>
Oh fucking hell! He probably saw where I am! Why was I too stupid to turn it off?</p><p>
I'll just lie my way through this. I answer the call. "What's up? I'm kind of busy."</p><p>
"I thought I'd ask how your recruiting and Telgon-strengthening's been going. But it looks like you're at the academy and Zak's not with you. What's up with that?"</p><p>
"Some of the people we were talking to wanted to be trained as Pygon warriors. I know it's not as good a way to strengthen my Telgon node, but we need warriors."</p><p>
"Fair enough. Alright, I'll get back to my own side." Ian hangs up.</p><p>
Tell me he's not going to call Zak and verify the story...</p>
<br><p>
I guess I have to go to where Zak is to prevent this story from collapsing when we all meet up. I arrive on the scene of him alone talking to a similarly-sized group of civilians.</p><p>
Zak is saying, "Is that really the kind of world you want to live in? You would have wanted to see my parents arrested just for training me with my consent? Because that's what the government would have done! They don't care if it's right or wrong; they just arrest anyone who threatens their monopoly on power!"</p><p>
He looks at me. "Telra? What are all those -"</p><p>
"I figured we might as well have them available incase some of the people want to join us as Pygon warriors. We do need mostly that, after all, and it's unreasonable to expect them to break into the training room themselves and steal them."</p><p>
Zak nods. I look at the civilians. "By the way, I left it open if any of you want to go grab some more. Now, does anyone want to be trained?"</p><p>
No one raises a hand. Damn. No one.</p><p>
I decide to show my anger. "How is this possible? You're all a bunch of cowards who don't deserve protection!"</p><p>
Zak's mouth hangs open. "What the hell, Telra? I thought you cared at least a little bit!"</p><p>
"There's no reason to fight to free someone who isn't willing to fight for their own freedom. I'm in this for myself and those I respect - like the cadets we recruited before."</p><p>
"And what about strategy?!?" Zak says. "Even if you don't care about these people personally, we need all the help we can get if any of us are gonna end up being free, and if you teach them about companions your Telgon node will get stronger and we'll have a higher chance of winning!"</p><p>
I hold back from saying "You think I give a shit about my Telgon node? I got these blades to train my own Pygon node, not to train others!" I'm still keeping up the pretense, although I'm pretty sure at least he sees through me now.</p><p>
"No thanks," I say. "I'll go recruit someone I care about." I walk away.</p><p>
But as soon as I'm out of his sight I realize how bad my own plan is. Even if I find someone willing to be trained, it'll still count as teaching so it'll still strengthen my Telgon node. And the Pygon growth will be miniscule because they won't be hurting me and I won't be able to hurt them much without a medical droid available. I kick the ground.</p><p>
Ugh... I might just have to go teach some normies. Why does life have to be like this? I've tried so hard. And I thought I was so talented. Why did everything go so wrong?</p><p>
But I know the answer to that. All this Telgon bullshit is because I lost to Zak. This is my fault. I just should've done better. Maybe, if this is all because of my legitimate mistakes, I should accept the consequences I deserve. My central principle is that only the strong deserve success. If I'm not strong enough to beat Zak, I don't deserve success.</p><p>
The only thing making this so hard to accept is that in this case the consequence for failure is the lack of a chance to be strong again. But maybe I'm being too pessimistic. I haven't seen the effect of the node conflict yet after all. Maybe it's not as big as I assumed. Maybe I won't have lost much Pygon strength after all this.</p><p>
In the end, I do end up teaching another batch of people about the Telgon node after they all refuse to be trained as Pygon warriors. I lecture for two hours.</p><p>
When most of the people have lost interest and left, I ask the remaining, "So what are your plans? Any of you going to help?"</p><p>
When they all shake their heads, I say, "Fine, you're fucking useless assholes, but I don't care. Your only purpose is to make my Telgon node stronger. And you've done that."</p><p>
I wonder as I walk away if any of them genuinely support the government and now feel guilty that they helped the rebellion. I don't look back to check.</p><p>
But as I'm on the way back for food (it's been about four hours; the others can't complain about this), a man in a business suit approaches me.</p><p>
"Hey," he says, "you're one of those rebels, right?"</p><p>
I guess he can tell because I have my blades out, even though they're collapsed. "Yeah. What do you want?"</p><p>
"I want you to train me."</p><p>
Whoa. Is this for real? It is... I see the same fire in his eyes I saw in the rebels before we left for our first operation.</p><p>
"My son was killed by the government," he says when he interprets my delay as asking for an explanation. "They told me he murdered someone, but I know it wasn't him. I reviewed the evidence... I'm certain they actually killed him for finding out about the Telgon node and framed him."</p><p>
"Welcome aboard," I say immediately. I toss him a pair of the spare blades I had in my pockets. "Those are yours now."</p><p>
The man looks down at the blades in his hands. He figures out how to extend them. His expression reminds me of my own the first time I held Pygon blades.</p><p>
I proceed to say, "The Pygon node gets stronger from experiencing and inflicting pain, especially with those blades. To catalyze it so it can start growing, you just have to have your first significant experience in combat."</p><p>
The man nods, then seems to realize the implication. "Wait - are you going to attack me?"</p><p>
I smile. "Of course. Don't worry, we can go to the hub so we'll have a medical droid."</p><p>
We're not far from it, and I insist on running so we get there faster. When we get -</p><p>
I see a crowd of soldiers in uniform standing on the hub grounds outside the police station. There must be a dozen of them. I turn around and start walking inconspicuously toward the nearest cover, but then I hear a voice speaking from the crowd of soldiers... Ashley.</p><p>
"We're here to fix your companions," she says.</p><p>
I jolt back around to see. It's her alright. She's fixing the companions of the soldiers stationed at the hub. And I see her eyes widen as they land on me.</p><p>
Shit! I turn and bolt as I hear her ordering some of the soldiers after me. I am <i>not</i> getting caught by her again!</p><p>
The sword throw! I turn on my Pygon protection and -</p><p>
A blade pierces my back, followed by another shortly after. But the protection does wonders. Both blades leaves a minor wound and don't stick in, and I'm able to keep running. I feel a huge wave of relief as I turn a corner.</p><p>
I started far enough away from them that it should be possible to lose them in the metropolis. I just have to keep turning corners while making sure I don't end up heading back toward them. I think about trying to run inside a building and hide, but if the door is locked, I couldn't exactly break in without leaving it obvious, and I'd have lost time.</p><p>
I eventually lose them just by running. Or at least I think I have. I don't hear them behind me, and I haven't run past any bystanders in a few blocks. I'm incredibly tired. And my wounds are excruciating. I don't think I'm in danger of dying, but I really need a medical droid. On the bright side the pain is strengthening my Pygon node...</p><p>
I don't even know what happened to that man I was going to train. He's probably dead, since they saw him with me and he doesn't have protection.</p><p>
That was too good to happen, I guess. I understand. I'm lucky to be alive after my mistake with Brev. That's why it's fair that nothing is going the way I want it to. But I'll turn the tables. I'll redeem myself yet and kill Ashley...</p><p>
I sit down and call Ian, who answers immediately. "The government is... sending out the, Telgon hackers... to repair, people's companions."</p><p>
"Good to know. And unfortunate; that'll damage our public image. What happened?"</p><p>
"Ambushed. Ashley's in the area. Escorted by a dozen soldiers. That bitch..."</p><p>
"Well then, it sounds like we need to relocate. I'll find us another good place to stay. We'll bring the medical droid too."</p><p>
I want so badly to stick around the area and try to lure some of Ashley's bodyguards away and kill her. Even if it's not wise. But no, I'll get my chance. I just have to be patient and accept the suffering from my mistakes. I'm going to win after all this. I'll make it work.</p>
