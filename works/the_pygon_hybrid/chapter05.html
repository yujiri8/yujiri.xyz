Ian and I are the only ones who aren't crying. The others are all avoiding our eye contact.</p><p>
"God fucking dammit," Lucy says, staring back in the direction of the hub. "I'll kill them. I'll kill them all. I'll avenge you, Kelly."</p><p>
I'm just doing my best to stay quiet. The pain is still excruciating. I tell myself any normie would be screaming at the top of their lungs right now.</p><p>
Zak, meanwhile, is completely silent. Also looking out. I don't know what's up with him.</p><p>
Ian looks up from his companion. "I've confirmed my theory of how this happened. Those soldiers were off the government comm grid to stop hackers from seeing them. They knew there was a hacker with us, so they sent out a squad like that by word of mouth to every nearby place we'd be likely to strike."</p><p>
None of the others respond. They don't care how it happened, now that it did.</p>
<br><p>
We arrive at the hideout.</p><p>
"So," Ian says, "we only have one medical droid. It can only treat one injured person at a time."</p><p>
Zak says immediately, "Let Telra go first."</p><p>
We all look at him in shock. I thought he hated me? Weird. My injury <i>is</i> much worse, but instead of pointing that out, given what he and the others are going through, I find myself giving a sincere "Thanks."</p><p>
I lay down on the bed and let the medical droid do its work. Just a minute, and I'll finally be free of this pain. It's so much worse than the shallow cuts I'm used to from sparring. I breathe deeply, trying to be patient.</p><p>
I also realize after a minute that I'm incredibly hungry. I haven't eaten anything since the night I snuck out to get the weapons with Brev. And now it's afternoon. I feel like it's a really inappropriate time, but I can't fast forever. "So uh... How do you get food here? If the government knows you're all fugitives..."</p><p>
Getting anything as a fugitive should be hard, but food is an entirely government-controlled industry. They have a huge agricultural district that produces all the food and people buy it from the government. (Even though it's already being produced with taxpayer money...)</p><p>
Ian answers. "I hack the delivery bots at the warehouses to send it to us without processing a payment, and then I wipe their logs so no one can trace it. We've got some in the apartment from last time." He heads into the kitchen to prepare some food. Zak and Lucy both go out for a walk, leaving me and Thale alone as the medical droid repairs my arm.</p><p>
"Fuck it," Thale says again.</p><p>
I try to think of something to say that doesn't sound cliched and won't be insincere. Eventually I land on, "Did she make you proud?"</p><p>
Thale cries profusely. "Yes! She was the best person I've ever known! She fucking died for the cause! She knew what had to be done when you and Zak didn't!"</p><p>
Ouch. He's right though. If Zak and I had've stayed by her side, she might still be alive.</p><p>
"Well..." I'm kind of trying to lighten the mood. "Then that's good, right? At least she got to die a hero."</p><p>
Thale clenches his fists. "I know... dammit. I told myself sacrifices come with war. But nothing could have prepared me for this. The girl I spent fourteen years raising and training, laughing and talking with her, learning from her perspective on the world, she'll never live to adulthood. And I'll never to get to even tell her how much I miss her already."</p><p>
We sit in silence for a moment, and then Thale continues, "To think that I'm doing this to an entire family every time I kill a soldier..."</p><p>
Oh no. Tell me he's not going to go there. I'm so sick of heroes in fiction written by normies having qualms about killing the bad guys. "You know the police deserve to die," I say. "They would have arrested you and Lucy for training your kids underage and your kids for not reporting you. They've probably arrested other people for less."</p><p>
"I know, the police have to go... but do their families deserve to lose them? What if one of their kids was someone like Kelly?"</p><p>
"Would she understand?" I ask.</p><p>
Thale nods. "That's a wise point. Kelly would always understand if something had to be done. She would accept reality and focus on fixing it instead of despairing. That's what I must learn. I'll continue her ideal of making the world a better place. A free place where everyone can interact voluntarily and sell their skills however they want to anyone who has use for them. That's what I live for. And I'll kill as many people as I have to to make that world happen."</p><p>
"I'll be helping you the whole way," I say immediately. I make the same symbol-of-power gesture with my fist that Kelly made. "I'll make sure that world happens some day. Even if you die too, I'll be there to carry on the fight."</p><p>
Thale makes eye contact with me for the first time in this conversation. "Do you mean that? I thought you were only in this for yourself."</p><p>
"Well..." I guess I did kind of speak without thinking. But maybe it's become true. Would I be satisfied if I was allowed to be a mercenary and a vigilante but everyone else still had to follow the law?</p><p>
"I think meeting you all made me realize that there's a way to not be a normie without being quite like me and Brev. I wouldn't want people like you to have to live under the government either. And despite how it might look, I really do admire you all. Just being brave enough to fight the government gives us more in common than we have apart."</p><p>
Thale actually smiles a bit. Then Ian comes in with microwaved pizza and sets a plate before each of us. "Thank you, Ian," Thale says. "Thanks for not being too broken to function like I was."</p><p>
"Easier for me," Ian says, "since I only knew her for a week. Especially since she died to protect me, I have to do what would make her proud."</p><p>
We eat in silence, and the medical droid finishes healing my arm. I contact Zak with my companion. "Zak, the medical droid's available."</p><p>
Zak's voice is still intensely downcast. "Alright, I'll come back."</p><p>
Thale gets up and walks toward the door. "I'm going to go find Lucy. Being alone for this long after a loss isn't good."</p><p>
Ian and I are left alone, him working on his companion and me having nothing to do. I decide to ask, "So how do we have this apartment? Did you also rent it fraudulently?"</p><p>
"The landlord is unaware that we occupy it," Ian says. "He has over thirty rooms, after all. There are always a few that are empty."</p><p>
"So if he decided to lease this room to someone..."</p><p>
Ian clicks his tongue. "Then we might need a new hideout."</p><p>
It makes me realize something. "You know, this gang... We're an improvement over me and Brev and company, but we're still not very powerful, are we?"</p><p>
"No. But we're all there is. We'll make it work."</p><p>
"I guess I'd better get honing then. I'm gonna go practice my sword throw technique. Do we have a room for that or something?"</p><p>
"Just do it on the wall in here. Nobody cares. When this is all over we'll make sure the landlord's compensated for his troubles."</p><p>
I take a throw at the wall. By the time Zak and Thale and Lucy get back to the hideout, I wouldn't call myself an expert, but I don't think I would miss from barely a few yards away like I did last time.</p><p>
I turn around to see them come in. Ian says, "Hey, how are you two doing?"</p><p>
Lucy responds immediately. "You wanna know how I'm doing? The government took my daughter from me. Someone I loved and admired. They think they can fuck with me like that? I'll fucking kill them all and spill their guts all over the floor!"</p><p>
"Damn," I say quietly to myself. Not that I have any qualms about that, but it's a lot gorier than I expected.</p><p>
"Zak?" Ian asks.</p><p>
"What do you want from me," he says as he goes to have the medical droid treat his wound. He sounds more depressed than defensive or angry though.</p><p>
Ian gives the same reaction Lucy gave when I said that. "Well, since it seems like everyone could use some good news, I sent out the message. Everyone knows the truth now. The revolt is official."</p><p>
"How many recruits you think we'll get?" I ask him.</p><p>
"Not enough to make it a fair fight, that's for certain. Especially since most of them will probably be civilians with no Pygon or Telgon abilities. And we don't exactly have months to train them. Also, we have to worry about infiltrators. The emperor'd be an idiot not to try that. And he knows one is all it takes to kill us all, so even if we know someone's killed police, that
still doesn't make it safe to trust them, since the emperor's willing to make that sacrifice. We'll still be on our own."</p><p>
"Then what was even the point?!?" Lucy says. "We can't do this alone!"</p><p>
"Don't worry, they'll get to help us! We'll form some kind of network of mostly independent cells. And we will find a way for recruits to prove we can trust them eventually, it just won't be easy, and I'm not sure how yet."</p><p>
"Also," Ian continues. "I need an apprentice."</p><p>
"We've already all said no to that," Thale says.</p><p>
"I'm not a god!" Ian says. "Now that the government's on to us and they know we have a hacker, all of theirs are going to be tasked with finding us, and there's no way I can outhack them all when they do. Especially if they start recruiting more - which they probably will now that the information about their spying is public anyway. If I train an apprentice, we'll be able to
stack our power against them, and training one itself will make me a lot stronger."</p><p>
I look at him for an explanation. He says, "The Telgon node grows from learning and teaching like the Pygon node does from giving and receiving pain. And knowledge about companions is worth several times what other knowledge is."</p><p>
"Hold on," I say, "then what about the broadcast? You taught thousands of people. Shouldn't that have..."</p><p>
"Disconnected teaching like that doesn't count. Disconnected pain wouldn't count for Pygon either. So that's why one of you has to do this."</p><p>
<!--"I can't keep being a single point of failure!" Ian says. "Kelly only had to die protecting me because I was the only one! If we had a second hacker, I wouldn't be so important. We're at war. It's too dangerous for any one of us to be unexpendable."</p><p>-->
"Well I'm not doing it," I say.</p><p>
"Yes you are," Zak says. "Because I'm not, and I get priority."</p><p>
"Whoa, what the hell Zak? You think you can make me?" I say this in an entertained rather than offended tone.</p><p>
"Yes, and here's how: we'll spar. Loser has to be the hacker apprentice."</p><p>
"You're on." Wait. Shit. What did I just get myself into? I said it so fast because his challenging tone provoked me, but am I certain I can win this?</p><p>
It should be fine. He's younger than me, and it ends by yielding, so willpower matters, and I definitely have more willpower. This should be fine.</p>
<br><p>
As soon as Zak is healed, he and I stand at opposite sides of the room, everyone else having cleared. I'm going to show him who's boss.</p><p>
I charge in first, reversing the usual paradigm of me versus Brev. Already Zak lands a speed swing on my leg while he stable-blocks both my swords with his other. Damn, I should really should learn to make that impossible.</p><p>
We clash for a few more seconds before I take another cut. Shit! How is this going so badly?</p><p>
I jump back, fearful that my demoralization will make me fight worse. I need to reasses the situation. I'm still going to win. I just need to be more careful.</p><p>
Zak rushes me, and finally I manage to at least trade with him. Zak retreats. There we go. <i>Threw off your groove, did I?</i> Now that I've shown him things can turn around, maybe that'll cripple his morale.</p><p>
I rush next. I try to back him into the wall with aggression, but I mess up and take another cut as he escapes to the side.</p><p>
Shit! Didn't I tell myself I was going to be more careful? Now I have four wounds to his one! This isn't working. I have to do something.</p><p>
I stand my ground, bleeding in several places, trying to think on my feet of something creative I could do. But Zak doesn't give me time.</p><p>
He comes in aggressively, probably hoping to deal a final blow. I try to circle around him and land a good power hit or two, and I do, but he also lands one on me, and my knees buckle. I think my kneecap is broken. Oh god.</p><p>
Zak clears some distance. "I win, don't I? Come on!"</p><p> 
I try to get up. It's no use. Oh fuck it hurts so much. I'm out of options. "Fucking yes! Help me!"</p><p>
Zak and the others help me get back to the medical table. Fucking hell, it's the midnight ambush all over again. I lost. I <i>fucking</i> lost... And now I have to be Ian's apprentice.</p><p>
I cry again. "I'm not fucking doing this!" I say, although I don't really believe myself.</p><p>
"You chose this!" Zak says. "If you can't even do what you promised after losing a fair fight, then who's really the weakling here?"</p><p>
"You don't understand!" I yell at him. But the worst part is I know he's right. If I won the fight and he tried to escape his promise, I'd lose all respect for him.</p><p>
They're all looking at me, their eyes forceful, telling me how I deserve this. "Just go away!" Please let them honor this last request.</p><p>
The others look at each other for a moment, all nod, and then go outside. Thank god. At least I can suffer alone.</p>
<br><p>
Fuck.</p><p>
What the fuck am I going to do?</p><p>
I can't do this. I can't stop being a fighter. I have to tell them no, period. What will they do? Will they torture me into doing it?</p><p>
Fuck, honestly submitting to that would be so much worse than submitting now that I think I can't tell them no just incase they resort to that. Even letting them threaten to torture me and then submitting would be worse than submitting now. I can't tell them no. And I can't tell them yes.</p><p>
I consider running away from them. But no, I can't duck the government for long without Ian's protection.</p><p>
Fuck, there's no way out of this nightmare. Maybe I'll wake up later and this will be just that.</p><p>
But I know that's not going to happen.</p>
<br><p>
After the medical droid finishes repairing my kneecap, giving me a blood transfusion, and healing my cuts, I get up and go outside. I climb on top of the apartment.</p><p>
To my surprise, Zak is up here too, hanging his legs off the edge. "Hey, Zak, I want you to know I don't hate you."</p><p>
"Thanks," Zak says. "I want you to know why I had to do that."</p><p>
"I thought it was out of character."</p><p>
Zak suddenly shouts. "I had to do it because I deserve to die!"</p><p>
"Whoa, what the hell? Are you serious?"</p><p>
"It should've been me instead of Kelly! She was always a better person than me, less lazy, less selfish, braver, and when we had to protect Ian, she was the only one willing to sacrifice herself! She died <i>because</i> she was the one who least deserved it! And now I have to pay the price for my sins... I have to be the next one to die. I deserve that fate."</p><p>
"Even more than me?" I ask. "I'm not even a real moralist. I don't give a shit about normies. Even though I've come to respect people like you, I'm still what you'd call a bad person."</p><p>
"It's harder for you," Zak says. "You were raised to believe that there's only one kind of person: normies. And so the only way you could think of to rebel was to be the opposite of that. It's impressive enough that you turned out as good as you did, given the childhood you had. But I was raised to be a rebel from my first breath. And I still wasn't good enough to keep Kelly
alive..."</p><p>
I think I genuinely feel sympathy for him. In a way that I literally never have before. He's like me. He has courage and ambition, but he hates himself for not being good enough. Except he's still stronger than me.</p><p>
"Well," I say, "for what it's worth, I admire you. You were brave enough to insist on not being Ian's apprentice."</p><p>
"It's not like that redeems me. Kelly's death is on my hands. And there's no way I can ever make up for that failure."</p><p>
As I search for something else to say, my thoughts return to my own predicament. "Shit, when I talk to you I can forget for just a minute about what I have to do."</p><p>
"I'm sorry," Zak says. "I really am. But I have to do this."</p><p>
"I understand. I'll find a way. Somehow..."</p><p>
Zak leaves me alone on the roof. I come to a conviction: I'll train both nodes at once. I don't care if it's impossible. This kind of insane aspiration and overconfidence is what makes me who I am, isn't it? And these rebels are the same way, thinking just the six of us could topple the government. If they can get away with it, so can I.</p><p>
A minute later, I come back inside. "Ian," I say. "I'm ready for Telgon training."</p>
