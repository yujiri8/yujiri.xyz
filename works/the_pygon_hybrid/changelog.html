<p><b>2019 June 13</b>: I added a lot of thoughts to the main scene in chapter 1. Oh, and I changed the name of the currency in chapter 2 from "digicoins" to "tokens". Digicoins was supposed to just be a placeholder name and I completely forgot it was still in there when I posted this.</p>
<p><b>2019 June 4</b>: I finally got around to a wave of edits I've been wanting to make for a long time! I've inserted some proper foreshadowing of later twists, and improved some conversations, including Telra's reconciliation with Brev, Thale's dialogue before the academy mission in chapter 6, the beginning of chapter 4, and a lot of new dialogue
during the dinner scene in chapter 6.</p>
<p><b>2019 April 22</b>: I made several small dialog edits; added a line in chapter 4 where Kelly makes a token effort to reason with the guard before they kill him; a line in chapter 1 about Telra's reasons for being so determined to be a warrior; and some minor edits to the end of chapter 3 and the beginning of 4.</p>
<p><b>2019 April 12</b>: I edited chapter 1 mostly to make the opening scene better.</p>
<p><b>2019 April 11</b>: I removed the mention of laser turrets being a thing in chapter 1. I hadn't used them yet and I didn't have any plans to use them in the future.</p>
<p><b>2019 April 10</b>: I finally added chapter 7! I wasn't really done editing it, but I felt bad about going over two months between chapters. I'll probably edit it some more before chapter 8. I've been having major ideas about where the story is going to go - it's not where I originally thought. I also need to consider whether anything in the first 7 chapters needs to be
changed to foreshadow it. It definitely needs some foreshadowing, I'm just not sure how early it needs to start and I didn't see any good opportunities looking over them.</p>
<p><b>2019 April 8</b>: Fixed several plotholes. In chapter 2, I added an explanation of why Telra isn't afraid of Brev turning her in after she takes revenge, and in chapter 6, I made it so there's only two batches of cadets in session (they don't have infinite medical droids), and fixed the scene where they find the soldier playing Mech Wars (can't do that with a
broken companion - I'm an idiot lol).</p>
<p><b>2019 March 26</b>: I revised the conversation between Telra and Brev in the end of chapter 2. I thought the beliefs Telra expressed kind of contradicted what she said later. And I edited Ian's explanation of why he needs an apprentice so badly to mention that the government will probably start recruiting more hackers themselves.</p>
<p><b>2019 March 18</b>: I changed the scene where Ian explains why he needs an apprentice so that his main argument is the inadequacy of his Telgon strength alone instead of the "single point of failure" argument (which arguably doesn't even make sense because they have to play to their outs). Also, I want to reassure you that I <i>am</i> working on chapter 7 - I took a long
time off but in the last few hours I wrote almost 1600 words in it.</p><p>
Update: I edited chapters 2-4 so that the rescue in chapter 3 is foreshadowed (Telra finds out about the rebels in the end of chapter 2).</p>
<p><b>2019 March 3</b>: I did some minor editing of all six chapters, in particular to institute some more thoughts I've been having about the world. All the government facilities - academies, hospitals, courts, etc - are clustered together in "hubs". I also changed the clerk's behavior in chapter 2 to be more realistic, and I'm thinking about adding some foreshadowing of the
rescue in chapter 3, as I'm worried that it's kiiiinda a Deus Ex Machina as is.</p>
<p><b>2019 February 17</b>: I made some edits to the scene in chapter 6 where Thale and Ian talk to Zak about his inferiority complex, I edited chapter 5 to make it more clear that food production is entirely government-controlled, and I made Pygon blades collapsible (it seemed iffy that the rebels got away in chapter 6 without any malevolent citizens identifying them if their
blades were visible). Let me know if I missed any parts that need to be edited to account for that.</p>
<p><b>2019 February 16</b>: I made some dialogue edits to chapter 6 (particularly Thale's line to the effect of "we're not gonna die" during the escape and Ian's line about Mech Wars), and fixed the chapter 5 link on the left of the chapter 6 page (it pointed to chapter 6).</p>
<p><b>2019 February 5</b>: I added chapter 6!</p>
<p><b>2019 January 19</b>: I decided to just make the rebels leave Kelly's body behind. I also slightly changed the explanation in chapter 5 of how the rebels get food. I've been thinking about the world a lot, and it led me to this.</p>
<p><b>2019 January 16</b>: I finally found a way to fit the solution to the problems of fake sci-fi into chapter 1! I'm still trying to decide what they should do with Kelly's body in chapter 4/5 though. Update: I also added a line in chapter 3 where it's made clear that the government controls the entire world. I would still like to find a way to mention that the world is much
smaller than Earth.</p>
<p><b>2019 January 13</b>: Did I just write and publish all of chapter 5 in less than 48 hours? Holy shit. I used to count myself productive if I wrote 300 words a day and did no other work. I guess I've come a long way as both a person and a writer.</p>
<p><b>2019 January 12</b>: Added chapter 4! Also several edits to chapter 3 to make Telra's thoughts more human. I added a few references to how bad the pain is, and also mentioned that she's crying before the rebel gang show up.</p>
<p><b>2019 January 6</b>: A small but very important edit to chapter 1: not only experiencing pain, but also dishing it out strengthens the Pygon node.</p>
<p><b>2019 January 5</b>: I changed Telra's thoughts in two scenes in chapter 2 to make her feel less remorse for what she did to Ashley and the clerk. I'm trying to make her start out as a worse person, so that her arc has farther to go, and so that she doesn't look as much like a Mary Sue in the beginning. In chapter 3, besides removing her apology to Ashley for consistency
with the chapter 2 edits, I made a lot of edits to Telra's thoughts, mostly expanding them, as I felt that I was kind of glossing over emotionally significant parts like the moment where she picks up her blades. I also changed Ashley's dialogue before the battle so that she doesn't mention the Telgon node, only refers to "the secret surveilance team". An effect is that Telra
blames herself more for the failure (since she could have reasonably assumed that the government was listening through her companion).</p>
