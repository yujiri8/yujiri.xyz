TITLE The Pygon Hybrid: Index

The second oldest thing I wrote that I didn't scrap. It was supposed to be an attempt at a sci-fi story that avoided the problems of [fake sci-fi](/fiction/fake_sci-fi) (though the combat system was still arguably a fantasy one). I like to think it was a bit better than [Pillars of Life](../pillars_of_life/), with a less nondescript protagonist but still only worth keeping up here for historical interest.
