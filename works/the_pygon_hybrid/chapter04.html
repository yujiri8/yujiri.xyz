<p>
I wake up on a bed in a room with a medical droid and one of the rebels that saved me, looking away and on his companion. But this isn't the medical wing at the academy.</p><p>
I sit up. My wounds are apparently all gone. The room looks like an apartment, and my companion's clock says it's about ten in the morning.</p><p>
But looking at the thing reminds me: the government must be tracking me! How could the rebels be so stupid to not even turn it off?</p><p>
I yelp, tearing it off my wrist. "We need to get out of here!" I yell at the man standing in the room.</p><p>
He startles. "Don't worry, don't worry, your companion's safe. I fixed it."</p><p>
I squint at him.</p><p>
"I'm a hacker. Like Ashley."</p><p>
Four others - the four pictured in the news report - come in to the room.
<!--"Hi," I say, trying to break the silence in a way that doesn't sound intimidated.</p><p>
They turn around. "Telra's awake!" the man calls, and four others come in.</p><p>-->
Kelly says, "Congrats on the survival! We were terrified you wouldn't make it and all that would be for nothing."</p><p>
"Count me in to your insurrection," I say immediately, getting off the bed. "The government murdered my friends. And I'll murder them for it."</p><p>
"You know," the unfamiliar man says, "Brev and his wingmates were badguys. What they did to you they probably did to others. Just because you got to beat them up and join their little circle of exemption doesn't give you a right to forgive them."</p><p>
I yell. "They were my friends, okay? I don't care how they treated <i>normies</i>!"</p><p>
"That makes you a bad person too," the man says calmly. "Good people judge others based on the morality of their actions. And treating innocent people with respect is the cornerstone of that."</p><p>
"Well that's not what I've chosen to care about. I've never been a nice person and I'm not ashamed of it. I choose my own path."</p><p>
Everyone gives me an intensely disapproving look. Figures they're all gonna be like this. I can't complain about my luck.</p><p>
The unfamiliar man is still the one to speak. "Alright. You don't have to be a good person to help us. As long as we're both after the same enemy."</p><p>
"So who are you?" I ask. "You weren't in the news report."</p><p>
"Name's Ian. The team's hacker. I was hacking into all the cadets' companions in your batch and sifting through their data, looking for anyone who might be a candidate for recruitment. When I found you, we knew we had to contact you. And we were almost too late..."</p><p>
Something crosses my mind. "Hold on, if the government has all that surveilance data, how come I wasn't arrested for assaulting Brev and the clerk? They knew. Would I have been and it was only a matter of time?"
</p><p>
"They don't use footage of crimes with witnesses. Otherwise Brev would know something was up when you got arrested before he reported you. Or if they used the clerk's footage which you deleted - that was a horrible thing you did, by the way -"
</p><p>
I wave my hand dismissively. "Yeah yeah, whatever."
</p><p>
Ian continues, "but we'll work with you - then word would get out that all of everyone's data is being uploaded to government servers in real time. They only use it for crimes without witnessess, so the only person who knows they pulled a cheat is the criminal, who nobody believes. And even then they can often claim there was some unseen witness and nobody can
prove them wrong if they just say 'a dutiful citizen who wishes to remain unnamed' gave us this info, et cetera."
</p><p>
"I guess that makes sense. But still, I've done lots of things over the last few years I'm pretty sure were illegal and didn't have witnesses. Like just all the times I must have said out loud to myself how I didn't care about the law and would break it on a whim. I'm surprised I wasn't arrested years ago.
Even if I never stole or anything it must have been obvious I was trouble."
</p><p>
"Well, the autoanalysis system isn't really finished yet. It was invented in the last few decades and let me tell you, programming a computer to understand natural language well enough to reliably recognize sedition is a lot harder than programming it to recognize assault."
</p><p>
"But I'm pretty sure climbing on government buildings is a crime. And the ambush with Brev wasn't the first time I did that."
</p><p>
Ian shrugs. "Huh, not sure about that. Could be a bug. There's always bugs in a piece of software that complicated."
</p><p>
I look at him and notice he's missing something. "Wait, you don't even have Pygon blades?"</p><p>
Ian smiles. "Nope. My Pygon node's completely latent. But the team needs a hacker to counteract the government hackers and stop us all from meeting the same fate as your buddies, so I'm glad to fill the role of Telgon savant instead."</p><p>
"Telgon?" I say. "Wait... is there another special node in the human brain?"</p><p>
"Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that. The government keeps it secret because they can and it gives them more power. In fact even most of their Pygon soldiers don't know about it. They just keep a few that do so they can send them on missions where they'll be working with Telgon hackers."</p><p>
I nod. "Makes sense. So how does this Telgon hacking thing work?"</p><p>
"Basically it lets you digitize yourself. You see and feel what a sentinent computer would. You can move between systems over the net, send packets, control the hardware once you've gained root on the host machine... A fight between a Telgon hacker and a normal hacker for control of a system is
like a fight between you and someone with no Pygon node."</p><p>
Hm... computers are neat too, and it sounds like the Telgon node gives some really fun and unique powers.</p><p>
"That sounds pretty neat. Any chance you could train me to use my Telgon node too?"</p><p><!--Probably needs a creative tag-->
"I'd love to. I should warn you though, the two nodes of power conflict. If you start training your Telgon node, your Pygon node will weaken."</p><p>
I frown. "Nevermind then, I guess." (I assume it works like the Pygon node in that whatever fuels it doesn't have an effect until you've 'catalyzed' the node.)</p><p>
Ian sighs. "That's what I thought. No one wants to be my apprentice. Kelly and Zak won't do it either."</p><p>
Zak says, "It's just that my Pygon node is already so far along, I feel like I'm wasting a lot if I switch now."</p><p>
"Besides," Kelly says, "you're a great hacker, Ian! We don't need another!"</p><p>
I'm not sure if Kelly is just saying this to cheer Ian up, if it's a joking tease, or if it's actually true. Regardless, Ian responds with, "Well, I suppose I am pretty badass. I did save all y'all's lives, after all..."</p><p>
"Huh?" I say immediately.</p><p>
Lucy puts her arm around Thale and says, "So Thale and I had been planning to rebel for over a decade. We were waiting cause we knew we didn't have a chance yet, and we were training our kids in secret even though they're still two years underage for the academy... but I guess one time we were given
orders to arrest someone and we just decided we couldn't hold it in any longer. We betrayed our comrades and killed a bunch of 'em, not thinking about the consequences. Then we tried to run. We didn't even know about the Telgon node - the government only tells their most trusted operatives - so we woulda been
toast, but this Ian guy showed up out of nowhere and told us everything."</p><p>
Thale continues. "Ian had been a government hacker for years, kinda like us, but he turned rogue some time before Lucy and I rebelled. So yeah. That's how we formed."</p><p>
"Speaking of that," I say, "what's our plan for overthrowing the government? I know I'm not the one with a right to ask that, but... I can see now that six of us still won't be enough."</p><p>
"That's where I come in," Ian says with another smile. "Or rather, one of the many places I come in. Our plan is to get the populace on our side. I've hacked into almost every citizen's companion and left myself a backdoor, and I'm gonna broadcast a message to the whole world at once. I'll tell them everything about the Telgon node, how
the government's been keeping secrets from them from and spying on them, and I'll show them your companion's recording of Ashley and the instructor's confessions."</p><p>
"Sounds like a good idea. I'll transfer the file to -"</p><p>
"I already got it." Ian taps the side of his side. "Hacker, remember?"</p><p>
I suddenly realize the implied privacy violation. "What else did you read on my companion?"</p><p>
"Everything I was interested in."</p><p>
I clench my fists. "You wanna find out what your blood tastes like?"</p><p>
Ian doesn't flinch, or show any emotion. "Wouldn't you have done the same?"</p><p>
"To a <i>normie</i>, yes! But I'm not a normie! I wouldn't do it to people I respect!"</p><p>
"Why not?" Ian says. "Knowledge in the hands of a good person is strictly a good thing. At worst, the information will never be useful."</p><p>
"Well what about <i>privacy</i>? Did that occur to you?!?"</p><p>
"You would never have known if I hadn't told you, and what you don't know can't hurt you. I told you because I wanted this argument to happen so I could make this point."</p><p>
I guess he's right. It doesn't make sense given my other principles to have qualms about looking through friends' sensitive information. "Okay, but then I get to see yours."</p><p>
"Go ahead." Ian hands me his companion.</p><p>
I didn't expect him to give it to me so willingly. I take it somewhat awkwardly, as I realize I wasn't really interested in his information.</p><p>
"You can look through there over our journey, I guess," Ian says.</p><p>
"Where are we going?"</p><p>
"To kill some soldiers. We'll want to show off our power as the last piece of the message I'll be broadcasting. Without that, most people won't believe there's any real possibility of opposing the government. We gotta show them hope."</p><p>
"Sounds like fun," I say immediately. "I'm ready."</p><p>
Thale does a fist pump. "Hell yeah! We're finally gonna get real!"</p><p>
Everyone else seems enthusiastic as well. There's a fire in their eyes as we head to the nearest turboline port and grab a car. I guess they've been waiting for this moment for years. I can't imagine myself holding it in for anywhere near as long as these people did. I want to say I look down on them for not being brave enough to go earlier, but after how my own gig worked
out, I can't criticize.</p><p>
Our destination is a hub, but not the one I was going to. I open Ian's companion along the journey, since I don't want to look like I only demanded to see it as a token.</p><p>
"Who would've thought Ian plays strategy games," I say after I see his home page.</p><p>
Ian is quick to respond. "Is that a dismissive tone? Strategy games are a wonderful and wholesome form of competition, you know. They can teach many lessons about life and the human soul. Such as -"</p><p>
"Blah blah whatever," I say immediately. "Come on, we all know video games exist for fun, not to teach lessons."</p><p>
"Surely you're aware of the fallacy you just committed," Ian says.</p><p>
I actually am. "Meh, so what. I stand by my point."</p><p>
"Lesson #1:" Ian says, "getting over tilt. You inevitably have losing streaks when you play any competitive game, and seeing your rating plummet is always upsetting. Especially in a strategy game where you know your losses are caused by misunderstanding a strategic principle you thought you understood. That feeling
of regression of understanding is even more discouraging. But being through that and the recovery process so many times taught me to not be affected by it so much."</p><p>
"But by that logic almost anything can teach you lessons about life and the human soul."</p><p>
"Indeed," Ian says, "and many things can. But not everything is equally effective or holds the same lessons."</p><p>
I just shrug. I'm really not interested in this debate. He's made a good point, but it's not like that's going to convince me to play strategy games.</p><p>
Ian continues, either not picking up on my disinterest or not caring. "Lesson #2: when a battle is lost, it's best to give it up and devote your resources elsewhere."</p><p>
That one I can't resist objecting to. "But that's not even a good lesson! There's a word for someone who gives up because things look bad: a coward."</p><p>
"There's a line between persistence and recklessness. You don't have to give up on your ideals to recognize that when one endeavor becomes hopeless, you should switch your efforts to a different means of getting at your objective."</p><p>
I feel like he's right, which bugs me. I'm not going to let it look like my object was invalid. "So you can interpret around it. But the way you phrased it initially indicates that that's the way strategy games lead you to think about it. And if that's the case then they probably lead a lot of people down the path of weakness."</p><p>
Ian rolls his eyes. "So let me guess, you're an action game junkie yourself."</p><p>
"Actually, no. I do prefer a game where I do better by trying harder, by focusing and reacting quicker. But action games have their own problems. They just remind me of how much I'd rather be fighting for real. In a real fight I'm not limited to a predefined set of moves and subject to pressing the wrong button or
some shit like that. And in a real fight I can do better by being strong-willed and not giving up."</p><p>
"So what's your pastime?" Kelly asks. "Do you read or watch movies or something?"</p><p>
"Actually, yeah, that's pretty much spot on. My favorites are the ones with competent villains and a main character I can respect."</p><p>
Kelly's voice is blithe. "I like those ones too. Stories are a great entertainment media because they're not only fun at the time, but you get to discuss them with your friends and remember them fondly for the rest of your life. In a way, they're eternal, even if the story itself is temporary."</p><p>
I nod wordlessly as I turn my attention back to Ian's companion. The next thing I notice is an untyped file named "database". It's size has more digits than the tooltip can display.</p><p>
"Hey Ian, what's this 'database' thing?"</p><p>
"The government's parting gift to me. Before I went rogue, I downloaded as much confidential information from their databases as I could. That thing's the result."</p><p>
"Cool. What stuff do they have in there?"</p><p>
"Well, besides their surveilance data, scientific documentation of the discovery of the Telgon node, admission that our 'president' is in fact an emperor -"</p><p>
"Wait, what?" I ask. "The world is a democracy!" The way our world worked was that big decisions were voted on by each citizen, but small decisions were left up to an elected president or other officials he could appoint.</p><p>
"It's true that there's a voting process," Ian says, "but the vote doesn't matter. The votes are software-counted, and so of course the government hackers - who answer to the 'president' - control the counting of the votes."</p><p>
"Damn," I say. "What else is the government keeping from us?"</p><p>
"Well, there's evidence that all of our 'presidents' since the formation of the modern government have been the same person."</p><p>
I can't say I believe him on that one. The government has been around in its present form for over 200 years. I give him a skeptical squint.</p><p>
Ian goes on. "Most people can't figure this out because the personal information about him is kept confidential as much as possible "for his safety", but for one thing, all of our former presidents have died shortly after their term ended. There's also some remarkable similarities in their physical mannerisms."</p><p>
"So you're saying some hidden person is physically controlling them all?"</p><p>
"It's a possibility," Ian says.</p><p>
"But wait, isn't it impossible to tamper with the human brain without killing the subject? Not that I trust the government, but if they could, wouldn't they like, genetically amplify the police or something?"</p><p>
"Yeah, I personally don't buy this theory of Ian's," Lucy said. "Even if someone did have the ability to control another's brain, that still doesn't explain how this hidden man has lived for well over two centuries. There'd have to be that <i>and</i> immortality technology."</p><p>
Thale has been resting his chin on his palm this whole time, appearing deep in thought. He finally looks at something other than the distance and speaks. "Telra, are you scared?"</p><p>
I apply the principle Brev taught me. "Yeah, as much as the rest of you, but I'm brave enough to fight anyway. Besides, I've gotta redeem myself after what happened last time."</p><p>
"You didn't do anything wrong," Thale says. "Making a strategic oversight doesn't make you a bad person."</p><p>
"It does by my idea of good. I tortured Ashley in the sparring match because she was weak, not because I knew she was evil. And I don't regret it."</p><p>
Thale gives a frustrated sigh. "Are you sure? Aren't you just biased against reconsidering your actions now that you know she's evil?"</p><p>
I don't answer him. I don't do it on purpose, I just care so little about the question that I don't really register it.</p><p>
"Well?" Thale asks.</p><p>
"Uh... I'm not really thinking about it. And I'm not sorry."</p><p>
"Asshole," Thale says, and looks away.</p><p>
I raise my eyebrows. I got the impression that these people were super idealized moralists who tried to reconcile rebellion with politeness, so seeing him swear at me just for being rude is a little surprising. I can't say I don't kind of admire him for it though.</p><p>
Zak speaks up. "That must be terrible," he says, looking at me. "Believing that you're only a good person if you're powerful."</p><p>
"Not a problem for me, since I am powerful," I say, smiling slightly.</p><p>
"Oh come on," Zak says. "Weren't you just saying you had to redeem yourself for last time?"</p><p>
"Yeah, I made one mistake once. But I'm still a powerful person."</p><p>
"Well you know what, you still were a moron and got your buddies killed because you wouldn't listen to them, and you're only alive now because people you don't admire rescued you. Why don't you think on that?"</p><p>
I'm not quite sure how to take that. It's pretty vicious. But I've never really been affected by insults before, since I just couldn't care less about the opinions of most people who criticize me. But when he strikes there... maybe I should be angry?</p><p>
Lucy says, "You got bluescreened, Telra?"</p><p>
Shit. Now I look like a doofus if I don't respond, but I still haven't decided how to feel.</p><p>
"What do you want from me," I come up with. Lucy just shrugs in a "fair enough" way, and then everyone leaves me alone.</p><p>
In the silence, I think a little more about what I'm feeling with regard to fear. I spoke without thinking before because I wanted to say whatever reason told me made me brave. But if I'm being honest with myself, I really don't feel much fear right now.</p><p>
I guess it's because now that I know how the ambush happened last time and this time we have a hacker who's protecting us from that, I know it can't happen. Knowing the enemy's secret and that it won't be a problem is more reassuring than thinking they don't have a secret. I know that this time we're going to be the ones ambushing.</p><p>
"I lied earlier," I said.</p><p>
Everyone looks at me expectantly. I say, "I'm not afraid. As much as I kind of wanna be now."</p><p>
Kelly says, "Are you sure? It's not shameful at all to -"</p><p>
"Kelly, I know. Brev already convinced me to look at it that way." I explain my thought process. "So, actually, how come you guys <i>are</i> scared?"</p><p>
Thale is the first to answer. "For me, it's mostly about Kelly and Zak. Lucy and I have super strong Pygon nodes, so we know we're not likely to die. But the thought of seeing my kids die..."</p><p>
"We'll be careful," Kelly says. "We wouldn't you to have to go through that."</p><p>
I've completely discarded any suspicion that there's anything less than sincere about Kelly's personality. I think she really is just incredibly emotionally simple and all-loving. It's impossible to imagine her killing cops with us.</p><p>
"We signed on for this," Zak says. "We're not ready to die, but we're as close as we were ever going to get. And every good person has to put themselves on the line eventually."</p><p>
Strangely, I'm starting to respect Zak more. Despite what he said earlier it seems like he has similar values as far as courage being central to what makes a "good" person.</p>
<br><p>
We arrive at the destination turboline port. It's coming soon. I can feel a little fear now. It's exciting to get a rematch with the police, but I also know they're still going to be stronger than me and I'm likely to be at least injured.</p><p>
"Today will be our first trial," Kelly says. "Zak? You excited?"</p><p>
What is this? <i>Kelly</i> enthusiastic about killing people? I guess I judged too fast.</p><p>
"Yeah," Zak says, his voice rough. "Excited and terrified."</p><p>
"Good luck." Kelly smiles. They're common words, but they sound profound coming from her. How does she do it?</p><p>
Ian stays near the turboline port. "I'll stay here so I'm inconspicuous. I shouldn't be with you in the mess of combat, but I'll be into their surveilance network, making sure they don't know anything we don't want them to."</p><p>
"Sounds good," Lucy says. She turns to the rest of us. "So..." It's clear she's as nervous as Thale about sending her kids into battle. "I think it's best if we divide into two teams, Thale and I on one and the three of you on the other. We'll both make a point to fight only one soldier at a time. It seems like the closest we can get to balanced."</p><p>
The rest of us nod, and Lucy continues. "Kids... please... be careful, okay?" Her eyes seem to be watering. How can it be this scary? I guess I wouldn't know since I've never really loved anyone, but it still seems like she's overreacting.</p><p>
"It's the three of us against one soldier," I say. "What could go wrong?"</p><p>
Kelly shows her a clenched fist as a sort of... symbol of power or something, I guess. "You've trained us well," she says. "Now it's time for us to make you proud."</p><p>
Lucy nods. "Alright. Good luck, everyone."</p><p>
Zak and Kelly and I find a guard. There aren't that many on hub grounds when there's no exceptional circumstances (which Ian assured us there's not), so they're all by themselves. We approach him, fanning out to surround him against the wall of the nearby building.</p><p>
He notices our Pygon blades. "Who-" he doesn't finish his sentence. He can tell at least Zak and Kelly are underage to be soldiers. He extends his blades. "What do you want?"</p><p>
"Freedom," Kelly says, sounding tranquil but forceful. "For everyone. Including your family." I chuckle a bit when she adds that.</p><p>
The guards speaks to himself. "Dammit... Here goes..."</p><p>
"Let's go," I say, extending mine and tentatively attacking. He blocks my first hits, after which I instinctively step back. Damn, this is scarier than I thought when I don't feel like I have no choice.</p><p>
My approach was a bit too early. His swords are ready in time to block both Zak's swings and step away from Kelly. He manages to slip out between Zak and the building.</p><p>
"Damn it!" I say as I try the sword throw for my first time. I miss. Shit.</p><p>
Worse, my throw reminds him that the technique exists and he turns around in time to block Kelly's much better-aimed throw. Two of us are down a sword now. I almost laugh a bit at how badly we just failed.</p><p>
On the bright side, the soldier can't run because he knows he can't face away; six sword throws would probably kill him even through protection. He seems to decide he's better off staying on top of me and Kelly's swords and letting us re-surround him than trying to retreat to a better position and letting us retrieve them.</p><p>
"Fuck this!" the soldier says. "This isn't fair!"</p><p>
It feels so awkward to hold just one sword. I can't decide if I should hold it with two hands for more power or one hand for more flexibility. Kelly and Zak both attack faster than me this time, and the soldier blocks with both his swords; but Zak is good enough to make sure one sword can't block both of his, and he even knew which one to make a power attack, nearly
cutting off the soldier's leg.</p><p>
My own power attack lands shortly after, cutting deeply into his chest. He tries to run again, but his leg can't support him anymore, and he falls over. A moment later he's dead.</p><p>
"Well," I say as I pick up my lost sword. "We did it."</p><p>
Zak is the first one to notify Lucy and Thale over our comm network. Lucy answers back. "Glad to hear it! I knew I could count on y'all! Thale and I kicked ass too."</p><p>
"It feels so good to have our first kill," Kelly says. "It feels like we're official now! Eh Zak?"</p><p>
This is even more extreme than before. Kelly really seems like a different person on the battlefield. Can't say I don't like this side of her a hell of a lot better though. In fact, from this experience alone I would think she was me.</p><p>
"Yeah," Zak says. "It had me pretty scared for a minute, but we made it just fine."</p><p>
Ian speaks next. "Hold on. There are still two more guards on the hub. You should - what? Shit."</p><p>
Kelly is the first one to bolt back to where we left Ian. Zak and I follow. Don't tell me this is going to go the same way as last time. It can't! Ian said he was certain he was blocking the government's surveilance network! This <i>can't</i> go the same way as last time!</p><p>
We turn a corner to find Ian talking with a group of four soldiers. Four. What the fuck.</p><p>
Lucy and Thale are also just arriving. This is going to be... one hell of a fight.</p><p>
Ian doesn't run toward us. He knows that if he does one of the cops will catch him with a sword throw, and he doesn't have Pygon protection. One of the soldiers, an older man, says, "I missed you, Thale, Lucy. It's poetic that I get to be the one to take you two down. I can't believe you even trained your children." He seems to be a commander.</p><p>
"What did you expect," Thale says. "It's a rebellion. We need all the freedom fighters we can get."</p><p>
"Stop talking!" Ian says. "He's buying time!"</p><p>
Thale and Lucy attack. Kelly and Zak also attack from the other direction, being careful not to put themselves between two soldiers. I try to do the same but I'm behind so I end up attacking a different enemy. All of our swings are blocked.</p><p>
The three soldiers besides the commander all come toward us. I guess they decide we're an easier fight to pick than the experienced Thale and Lucy.</p><p>
This is bullshit. None of us kids are as strong as them. Zak and I retreat a bit, trying to circle around toward Thale and Lucy. Kelly doesn't. What is she doing?</p><p>
"Stop!" she yells at us, actual panic audible in her voice. Then I realize: if she follows us then the soldiers will have a clear line of sword-throw to Ian. She can't risk losing our only Telgon hacker.</p><p>
Zak and I rush back into the fray. But Kelly's already taken a power attack that cuts off her arm. Zak tries frantically to cover for her, but he takes a speed hit himself. Kelly continues to fight with one arm.</p><p>
I'm content just distracting one of the three soldiers. This is already more than can be expected of me. But Zak and Kelly are helpless against two enemies! I have to do more!</p><p>
Too late. Kelly's head is cut off.</p><p>
Oh fuck...</p><p>
Thale and Lucy have injured the commander, and he's trying to run. Instead of pursuing him they switch to flanking the two soldiers Kelly and Zak were dealing with. I just keep tangling with my one enemy.</p><p>
I have to use Pygon strengthening to stabilize every block incase he uses a power attack. I could try to react but I'm not risking that in a situation where I don't think it's certain death if I don't. Even still, I receive a cut on my arm deep enough that my muscles become unresponsive and I drop my sword. I pull my arm back and try to retreat as fast as I can without turning my
back. Thale, Lucy, save me!</p><p>
They do. It doesn't take them long to kill two soldiers whose backs are turned and then they turn on mine and kill him too.</p><p>
Thank god... I survived. I stand over the soldier's dead body clutching my arm. Fucking hell it hurts. "Let's go," I say, motivated more by my desire for medical attention than anything else. But then I remember what just happened to Kelly. I can't expect them to leave right after that.</p><p>
Zak screams at the top of his lungs. "Fuck it! Fuuuck!" He sinks to his knees over Kelly's body. Thale and Lucy follow.</p><p>
"Please, let's go!" I say. They aren't listening to me. It's not like I can blame them.</p><p>
"Don't waste her sacrifice!" Ian says. "We gotta go before reinforcements show up and someone else dies!"</p><p>
After a few more seconds, the others finally manage to pull their eyes away from Kelly's dismembered body, and we head back to the turboline port.</p>
