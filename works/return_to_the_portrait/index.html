DESC Return To The Portrait continues from DDLC and explores Project Libitina and all the file secrets.
MARKDOWN

Return To The Portrait is a fan work I made for [Doki Doki Literature Club](/reviews/ddlc). It picks up from the end of the original game and involves everyone working together to find out the truth about their world and about Project Libitina. It features a ton of file tampering and other meta stuff like exploring the rules behind Club President powers. Estimated play time is maybe... 8 hours?

Since I was forced to develop on Renpy 7, it needs to ship the Renpy engine instead of using the one DDLC comes with (which is Renpy 6). So it requires a slightly different install process: unpack the mod distribution and drop the DDLC asset archives (`images.rpa`, `fonts.rpa`, and `audio.rpa` - *not* `scripts.rpa`) into its game/ folder.

## Downloads

[PC version](rttp-pc.zip) - this is the "PC" distribution generated by Renpy, which apparently works on both Windows and Linux.

[Mac version](rttp-mac.zip) - this one I unfortunately couldn't test, since I don't have access to a Mac.

[Windows-only version](rttp-win.zip) - this shouldn't be necessary as the PC distribution appears to work on Windows, but if somehow it doesn't for you, give this one a try.

[Linux-only version](rttp-linux.tar.bz2) - again, shouldn't be necessary but I'm including it just incase.

The unzipped source is [on Github](https://github.com/yujiri8/rttp).

## Retrospective

I spent over a year on this. It was a rough one with this and everything else in my life fighting for attention. I had a bad habit of putting too many things on my plate without thinking it through, but this might've taught me a lesson for good. At some points I wondered if it was a mistake to start this. Once I even considered dropping it. I can't express how ecstatic I am to be "free" from RTTP (that's really how I felt about it at times), and finally able to really pursue other projects, but I'm glad I stuck at it. This is an accomplishment I'll remember.

RTTP definitely taught me *a lot* about storytelling. I'd like to write about some of the wisdom I've gained from the pains, though I'm not sure when I'll get around to that. It also gave me enough experience with Renpy to be qualified to [review it](/software/renpy).

Also... I spent $791 comissioning assets, so [donations](https://paypal.me/yujiri) would be very much appreciated :P

## Self-criticisms

As with everything I make, not all of my decisions seem as good to me now as they did at the time. I'm still quite proud of RTTP, but I've come to see several flaws with it. (<span style="color:var(--yellowcolor)">Obviously, there are major spoilers below.</span>)

* The plot is riddled with contrivances. Each time I introduced a new admin API or a new rule for them or made something happen that wasn't foreshadowed, I did it with great sorrow. There are so many of these. And still there are plotholes.

* I inflicted death or trauma on characters only to heal it in the next scene so often that those things lost their meaning to an extent I think is really bad. The chapter 6 one especially.

	My memory from so long ago is very murky, but I think I was motivated to do a lot of this by feeling a need to 'add tension' or something, and didn't realize I was actually taking it away.

* Sayori's dialogue about how it feels to be admin should've been in part 1. I realized this as I was writing it, but I didn't want to go back and make such significant changes. And then I'd have to think of something else to give Sayori.

* I deeply regret how little most of the player's choices end up mattering. I wanted to write a mod where the player could significantly influence the relationships that develop among the characters and almost every choice would affect something by the end, but few of them do. At least I didn't do any of those completely fake choices like Rainclouds did.

* I think a significant suboptimality is how the gang mostly together throughout the story. It made it very hard to give each character a fair share of limelight, especially with admin status overshadowing everyone that didn't have it. Next time I write a story I'll be more conscious of this and try to separate characters more often. But the nature of admin abilities kind of makes it really difficult, since they pretty much kill spatial separation as a plot device until warp was broken.

* It doesn't make sense that the escape from the Portrait of Markov involves opening a discrete portal. That didn't happen when escaping DDLC, and it changing the surrounding area was odd too. Actually this is mostly because of budget. I'd already shipped part 2 with the portal image as Libitina's file without thinking too far ahead, and I didn't want to retcon that, but I also didn't have art of that room without the portal or with the portal closed, and didn't want to shell out than any more than I already had.

* The mass death in the ending probably felt too out-of-nowhere, and I worry that I abused the Mass Effect 2-style "kill off thousands of nameless faceless characters and hope it matters to the audience".

## Accepted plotholes

These are things I gave up on finding satisfactory answers to. I'll point them out myself just for interest's sake.

* Adam says he didn't want to make Libitina admin way back when, but given he obviously knew about both memory wiping and API breaking, why didn't he wipe her memories, break memory restoring, and then give her the power and she wouldn't know what he'd done to her? I'm pretty much resigned to leaving this as a plothole, but I'd very much appreciate any workable solution.

* Given the effective reality of the Portrait of Markov world, isn't staying there better than escaping, given they could be immortal (but retain the option to eventually leave) as well as pseudo-omnipotent? Adam's explanation of how the world is unsafe is pretty unconvincing, clearly motivated reasoning. I don't think there can be a satisfying answer to this and I'm not too upset about leaving it, but let me know if you have any good ideas.
