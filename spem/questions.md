TITLE Spem conlang: Questions

Boolean questions are easy: <spem>kɑ</spem> means "whether"; so a sentence that starts with <spem>kɑ</spem> is asking if it's the case.

Free-form questions, using "what", are the most important. The word, tentatively, is <spem>kem</spem>. I may need two of them though (in which case I'll consider shuffling around the <spem>ke_</spem> words so that <spem>keŋ</spem> is used). Here's the main issue with free-form questions: where does it go?

"What did you find?"

<spem>kem ɑn ŋi nuvi.</spem> - The English syntax. The question goes at the front regardless of how the sentence is formatted.

<spem>ɑn ŋi nuvi kem.</spem> - The in-place syntax. The question word takes the place of what it's taking the place of.

I like the in-place syntax on principle, but also worry about garden-path sentences. With the English syntax, I'm worried that not having the question word in its semantic place could be confusing in its own ways, especially if the subject of the question is long - I'd prefer it to end with the question word instead of with the verb.

For the currently listed version of <spem>kel</spem>, my solution is to have <spem>kel</spem> always go at the beginning and <spem>nɑ</spem> take the place of the thing if it's not the subject. But that's a speed penalty, and I'd prefer to not do it for free-form questions since they're so common. And this is what I meant when I said I might need two: another thing I've considered is to have both syntaxes via different words.

So that one's still kind of unresolved, but the others shouldn't need it. Words like when, where, and why, are easier and here's why: *they reduce to shortcuts for what*. "Where" is "at what", for example. And since they're prepositional phrases in disguise, they can just go at the beginning.

* <spem>kal</spem> - when (<spem>yel kem</spem>)

* <spem>kɑn</spem> - where (<spem>yɑ ak kem</spem>)

* <spem>kan</spem> - why (cause) (<spem>kem zo</spem>)

* <spem>kɪv</spem> - why (motive) (<spem>vi kem</spem>)

* <spem>kun</spem> - how (means) (<spem>ku kem</spem>)

* <spem>kɪl</spem> - how (degree) (<spem>lu kem</spem>)

* <spem>kɪn</spem> - when (<spem>yɑ ɪn kem</spem>)

* <spem>kev</spem> - for how long (<spem>vel kem</spem>)

<!--
kyɑ(n/l/m) - how (manner)
	# "yɑ kem"
	?? Do we need this? It doesn't seem that useful, and seems to create the impression that it has a distinct
	==?? meaning when it doesn't. After all, there are always infinite possible answers here.
		-- IDK. "You should've seen how he did it".
			That's not yɑ though.
	maybe it's just asking for details.
