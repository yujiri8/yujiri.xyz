TITLE Spem conlang open question: Variable dereferencing?
NAV Variable dereferencing?

I noticed a while ago that currently, there's an ambiguity with <spem>yɪŋ</spem>. It's a transitive verb that means "change", and I'd assumed that would include "set". But those two are different.

"I change my doctor". The literal meaning of "change" would entail that you change your doctor as a person, but in English this sentence is more likely to be meant as "I change *who my doctor is*". The problem seems to be that there's no distinction between a variable and its value.

Should I fix this by adding a pair different from <spem>yɪn</spem> and <spem>yɪŋ</spem> that means "set" instead of "change"; and the new ones are for setting a variable and the old ones are for changing an entity?

Or is a more general solution called for? Should I have a word that "dereferences" an expression, making it mean what it happens to be rather than what it's defined as, or is adding another pair of verbs the better solution?
