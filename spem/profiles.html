I mentioned in the <a href="index">index</a> that I believe our ideographic associations with sounds are not
entirely arbitrary, and that I believe it valuable to use the sounds "appropriately". Here I'll list all the
associations as I perceive them; it will likely be enlightening for me, others, or both.

<p>
A couple thoughts not on any particular phoneme:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
In general, bilabial consonants are physical. This is because they make us most conscious of our mouth.
</p></li><li><p>
Weak vowels get concrete, often physical things. "Big" vowels (particularly <spem>i</spem> and <spem>u</spem>)
get more abstract things.
</p></li><li><p>
For the most essential and common words, the above associations were less important to me than making them 1
syllable and giving them sounds I like.
</p></li><li><p>
Similarly, a lot of sounds have formed "happenstance associations" in Spem, that have less to do with me
thinking they actually sound that way and more to do with that I needed a family of related words that I knew
would all be used very often and I had a sound I'd been underusing.
Some examples would be all the <a href="questions">question words</a> starting with <spem>k</spem>,
and all the <a href="demonstratives">demonstratives</a> starting with <spem>t</spem>; this is probably
also how <spem>m</spem> got associated with "more/many".
</p></li><li><p>
I don't like words ending in stops, partly because it clashes with that most Spem words start with a consonant.
</p></li><li><p>
I basically never end a word with <spem>ɪ</spem>, <spem>a</spem>, or <spem>ɵ</spem>. It sounds cringey to me. I also
tend to avoid <spem>e</spem> at the end compared to not at the end.
</p></li><li><p>
I don't like phonetic repetition. I'm pretty sure this one is universal.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
While I tend to talk as if all this is a matter of correctness and I have completely pure intentions
in naming words, there's also a big element of vertical judgement here. I find some sounds more
beautiful than others and as such I'm heavily biased toward using them more. I'm not sure to what extent
these judgements are just me, so I should list those too.
</p>
<p>
My favorite vowels are, ordered, something like: <spem>i</spem> > <spem>u</spem> > <spem>e</spem> > <spem>ɪ</spem>,
<spem>a</spem>.
</p><p>
My favorite consonants: <spem>y</spem>, <spem>k</spem>, <spem>n</spem> > <spem>v</spem>, <spem>z</spem> >
<spem>r</spem> > <spem>l</spem>.
</p><p>
My only really disliked consonants: <spem>ð</spem>, <spem>b</spem>. I am biased toward reserving these for words that
are less common, physical objects, or things associated with something I don't like.
</p><p>
As you can see, as a general pattern I prefer voiceless stops and voiced fricatives.
</p>

<h2>Patterns</h2>
<p>
A few other patterns maintained more for the sake of consistency. If you see me going against these patterns
anywhere, call me out, cause I shouldn't.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
	When I have a transitive/reflexive verb pair, if either one ends in either, the transitive ends in
	<spem>i</spem> and the reflexive in <spem>u</spem>.
<!--</p></li><li><p>-->

</ul>
