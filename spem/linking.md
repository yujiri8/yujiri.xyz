TITLE Spem conlang: Linking clauses
NAV Linking

The two main types of linking clauses are "if _ then _", and "because _ therefore _". In most languages, these expressions don't distinguish between the different types of relationships they can imply, such as causation and deduction. For example, "If you do X, Y will happen" (meaning that X will cause Y) is a different meaning from "If you do X, that entails that Y will happen" (X might not be the cause of Y, but that it happens gives us reason to believe Y will happen). Spem distinguishes these different relationships:

* `ye` - if. Used for any type of relationship.

* `yey` - because. (Takes the place of `ye` when the premise is known to be true.) `yey` is not strictly necessary, since a premise clause without `ye` already means it's true, but it exists for clarity. If the premise is long, it can be useful to have a way to signal from the start from that it's a preface to something else.

* `zo` - causation.

* `ko` - entailment.

* `Î¸o` - entailment by definition. Note that the difference between this and `ko` is that this one needs no other premises, while for non-definitional entailment, what's actually going on is that other premises are being used (since strictly speaking it's impossible to actually entail something without doing so by definition).
