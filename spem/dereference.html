TITLE Spem conlang open question: Variable dereferencing?
NAV Variable dereferencing?
TEMPLATE DEFAULT

<p>
I noticed a while ago that currently, there's an ambiguity with <spem>yɪŋ</spem>. It's a transitive verb that
means "change", and I'd assumed that would include "set". But those two are different.
</p><p>
"I change my doctor". The literal meaning of "change" would entail that you change your doctor as a person,
but in English this sentence is more likely to be meant as "I change <i>who my doctor is</i>". The problem seems
to be that there's no distinction between a variable and its value.
</p><p>
Should I fix this by adding a pair different from <spem>yɪn</spem> and <spem>yɪŋ</spem> that means "set" instead of
"change"; and the new ones are for setting a variable and the old ones are for changing an entity?
</p><p>
Or is a more general solution called for? Should I have a word that "dereferences" an expression, making it mean
what it happens to be rather than what it's defined as, or is adding another pair of verbs the better solution?
</p>
