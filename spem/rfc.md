TITLE Spem conlang: open questions
NAV Open questions

(There are more open questions in [the dictionary](search). Ones that are specifically about an existing word go in the word's Notes field; to search for them, put "Open question" in the Notes box.)

## Directness

I need to deal with concepts of directness. In English, we often say things like "directly cause" drawing a relevant distinction between that and indirect causation. The distinctions *are* very important. I should probably have a different verb for that. I already spent <spem>zo</spem>, so maybe <spem>zyu</spem>?

## Quantifier problems

I've discussed this one in the comments on [quantifiers](quantifiers). I have no idea what a good approach is.

## Unnecessary consent

I have the adverbs <spem>jo</spem> and <spem>mo</spem> to indicate consent and thereby talk about rights. But there's an ambiguity: if I steal and you whack me in the head to get your stuff back, there might be a sense in which you whacked me without my consent, but it doesn't carry the moral weight it normally does because I don't *need* to consent since I'm the one who stole. Maybe we need both pairs of words.
