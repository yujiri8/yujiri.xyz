Spem has the following <b>phonemes</b> (sounds that are treated by the language as indivisible, and in this case all of them are). Where there's not an unambiguous English letter that corresponds, I'll indicate the sound by giving an example word and highlighting only the relevant letters.
</p><p>
The non-ASCII letters use <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet">IPA</a> symbols; there is a <a href="transliteration">transliteration scheme</a> for writing in pure ASCII.

<p>
You can see I've chosen basically the same phenome as English. This may indicate a bias on my part;
but I think English as a basis has strategic advantages because if Spem becomes successful, it
will likely spread to English-speaking communities first.
</p><p>
There are a few digraphs; in theory these are composed of the sounds of their letters, but I'll
list them anyway:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>e + i = w<b>ay</b></p></li>
<li><p>ɑ + i = h<b>i</b></p></li>
<li><p>ʌ + i = t<b>i</b>ght (note the difference from h<b>i</b>)</p></li>
<li><p>a + u = <b>ow</b></p></li>
<li><p>o + i = b<b>oy</b></p></li>
<li><p>e + u = (I don't know of this dipthong existing in any language except Latin, but it's pronounced just by sliding from <spem>e</spem> to <spem>u</spem>)</p></li>
<li><p>t + ʃ = <b>ch</b></p></li>
<li><p>d + j = <b>j</b>et</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Any combination of vowels not listed there, such as -ui-, is to be pronounced as two syllables.
</p>
<h1>Pronunciation guidelines and open questions</h1>
<h4><i>r</i> sound</h4>
<p>
What <i>r</i> sound should I go with? I like the English one more aesthetically, but I know it's very hard for people to pronounce
that didn't grow up speaking English and even English-speaking children often master this sound last, which indicates that it's not
a good sound for a designed human language. I could use the Japanese one, which doesn't seem to be as hard for English-speakers to
learn as vice versa (the English 'weak d' sound like in <i>pedal</i> is very close to it),
and I find it natural to substitute that sound during song.
</p>
<h4>No squishing duplicate sounds</h4>
<p>
When you have a word that starts with the same sound as the previous word ends with, they are to be pronounced
separately. Squashing them together as if they're a single letter will most likely result in a torrent of ambiguities
because I'm not making any effort to avoid it.
</p>
<h4>Voiceless stops stay voiceless</h4>
<p>
In English, voiceless stops become voiced if they're between a fricative and a vowel. For example, most people don't
notice it but <i>spell</i> is actually pronounced as <i>sbell</i>. Spem should not be pronounced this way; it limits
our phenome space. If a word is supposed to be pronouned <i>sbell</i>, it will be written that way.
(And hence the name of the language is <i>Spem</i>, not <i>Sbem</i>.)
</p>
<h4>Intervocalic unstressed stops</h4>
<p>
Something similar happens to intervocalic (between two vowels) unstressed stops. <i>icky</i> when said by an English
speaker is pronounced as something I'd write as <i>ikgy</i>.
</p><p>
I'd like to do away with that practice as well because it's inconsistent and wrong in principle, but that it seems to
happen in <i>every</i> natural language I've studied suggests that this might be inherently easier for the
human mouth, in which case I shouldn't try to force it. Thoughts? (I don't think allowing this can reduce
the phenome space.)
</p>
<h4>Dark <i>l</i>s</h4>
<p>
In English <i>l</i> is pronounced differently if it's before a consonant or at the end of the word. It's normally the
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental,_alveolar_and_postalveolar_lateral_approximants">dental
lateral approximant</a> (Wikipedia mislabels it as alveolar) but if you pronounce a word like 'milk' your tongue
probably never touches your teeth. I have the same feelings and the same ambivalence about this as I do about intervocalic
unstressed stops.
</p>
<h4>Accent</h4>
<p>
I haven't thought too much about accent, but there are a few rules I want to point out that are certainly for the
better.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
	Two-syllable words are always accented on the first.
</p></li><li><p>
	Non-substantial words (<spem>ki</spem>, <spem>nu</spem>, <spem>i</spem>/<spem>o</spem>, 1-syllable
	prepositions) are always unstressed unless semantically stressed.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
If we don't follow these rules, a lot of ambiguity will ensue, because in lots of 2-syllable verbs the first syllable
is another word.
