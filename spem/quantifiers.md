TITLE Spem conlang: Quantifiers
NAV Quantifiers

To use quantifier-type words like "always", "everywhere", "never", and "sometimes", use a quantifier prefix and a type suffix.

### Quantifier prefixes

* <spem>ki</spem>: every-

* <spem>mɑ</spem>: most

* <spem>ze</spem>: some-

* <spem>li</spem>: few

* <spem>nu</spem>: no-

### Type suffixes

* <spem>ji</spem>: place (-where)

* <spem>ti</spem>: time

* <spem>pi</spem>: person (-one)

* <spem>θi</spem>: case (used for place and time quantifiers when place and time aren't literal)

Examples:

* <spem>kiji</spem> = everywhere

* <spem>kipi</spem> = everyone

* <spem>nuti</spem> = never

* <spem>zeti</spem> = sometimes

* <spem>mɑθi</spem> = in most cases

* <spem>liθi</spem> = rarely

* <spem>liti</spem> = rarely (time being literal)

I'm not a fan of <spem>mɑ</spem> phonetically, especially the double bilabial consonant pair in <spem>mɑpi</spem>. But <spem>m</spem> currently has a profile of more/most/majority and <spem>ɑ</spem> a profile of vastness.

Also, yes, I realize that these meanings can all already be reached using words like <spem>kim dji</spem> = all places, but I'm adding these two-letter compound versions for speed. I don't think it would work to just make these versions the normal ones, because of phonetic collisions and words like "case" probably won't/shouldn't be 1-syllable anyway.

Although actually, writing that I partially convinced myself I should look into that more. <spem>ki</spem> is currently taken and I think both words are well-chosen, but maybe I could change one of them, and do that for all the ones that would collide? Comment below if you have any thoughts.
