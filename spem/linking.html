TITLE Spem conlang: Linking clauses
NAV Linking
TEMPLATE DEFAULT

<p>
The two main types of linking clauses are "if _ then _", and "because _ therefore _".
In most languages, these expressions don't distinguish between the different types of relationships
they can imply, including causation and deduction. For example, "If you do X, Y will happen" (meaning
that X will cause Y) is a different meaning from "If you do X, that entails that Y will happen" (X
might not be the cause of Y, but that it happens gives us grounds to believe Y will happen).
Spem distinguishes these different relationships:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
	<spem>ye</spem> - if. Used for any type of relationship.
</p></li><li><p>
	<spem>yei</spem> - because. (Takes the place of <spem>ye</spem> when the premise is known to be true.)
	<spem>yei</spem> is not strictly necessary, since a premise clause without <spem>ye</spem> already means
	it's true, but it exists for clarity. If the premise is long, it can be useful to have a way to signal from
	the start from that it's a preface to something else.
</p></li><li><p>
	<spem>zo</spem> - causation.
</p></li><li><p>
	<spem>ko</spem> - entailment.
</p></li><li><p>
	<spem>Î¸o</spem> - entailment by definition. Note that the difference between this and <spem>ko</spem> is
	that this one needs no other premises, while for non-definitional entailment, what's actually going on is
	that other premises are being used (since strictly speaking it's impossible to actually entail something
	without doing so by definition).
</p></li>
</ul>
