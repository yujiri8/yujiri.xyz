TITLE Spem conlang: The Tense System
NAV The Tense System

* `ɑn` and `im` are the past and future tense words. They go at the beginning of the sentence except for one special case which I'll get to.

* The present tense is progressive by default. `mi vɪrɪθ` means "I am running". If you want to communciate that you run in general, but aren't necessarily running now, use the `el` tense modifier: `el mi vɪrɪθ`.

	This also works with the past and future.  
	`el ɑn mi vɪrɪθ`: "I used to run".  
	`el im mi vɪrɪθ`: "I will get into running". A bit of a bad example, but the difference from `im mi vɪrɪθ` is that instead of just saying you plan to run, you're communicating that you're going to make it a regular thing.

	I call `el` the "vague tense" modifier.

* `ɪr` is the "close tense" modifier. `ɪr ɑn mi vɪrɪθ` means "I just ran", and `ɪr im mi vɪrɪθ` means "I'm about to run".

* `ɑŋ` is the "have done" tense, implying compared to the normal past that the action is still in effect.

* When you use `ɑn` or `im` to go into the past or the future, you *stay* in the past or future until you use `eŋ` to return to the present.

	`ɑn mi vɪrɪθ, to ni tel nɑi verɪθ av mi, kyo mi gu vɪrɪθ. eŋ el mi teku.` "I ran / was running, then they told me the truth, so I stopped running. Now(adays) I walk."

	I believe this saves more speed than it loses, but it's also for aesthetic reasons: it'd be ugly to have every sentence start with `ɑn` when telling a story.

	If it helps you can think of it like this: "The following sequence of events happened: I run, then he tells me the truth, so I stop running." And you might notice that in English we sometimes do a similar thing when telling a story, especially when it's supposed to be amusing.

	This doesn't happen if you place a tense modifier before the verb instead of at the beginning of the sentence.

	`mi ɑn zu A. kɑ ŋi zu B?`. "I did A. Are you doing B?"
	If it were `ɑn mi zu A. kɑ ŋi zu B?`, it would mean, "I did A. did you do B?"

* When using an explicit time-specifying expression, you don't need any tense modifiers. "I run yesterday" is quite clear and there's no need to add a syllable to move it to the past.

* You can double-use `ɑn` and `im` to get the "had happened" or (not very useful) "will be going to happen" tenses.

	`ɑn mi ɑn humi kim no lɪmɵl, kyo nu kei yɪm.` "I had already drunk all the water, so I didn't have any."

	You can also do like this: "`im ɑn mi humi no lɪmɵl`" - "I will have drunk the water". You're allowed to combine the tense modifiers in any way that makes sense.

* This should go without saying, but just incase, "is going to" should be translated the same way as "will".

**Open question:** my system for getting the double-past and double-future seems to lead to extreme ugliness if you want both layers to stick (meaning put both at the start). I don't think anyone wants to say "`ɑn ɑn ...`". This might not be a huge problem since the double-past is usually used in relation to the past, and so most of the time you'd probably only want one layer to stick (like I did in the example above). But is it still a problem?
