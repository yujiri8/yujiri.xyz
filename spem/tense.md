TITLE Spem conlang: The Tense System
NAV The Tense System

* <spem>ɑn</spem> and <spem>im</spem> are the past and future tense words. They go at the beginning of the sentence except for one special case which I'll get to.

* The present tense is progressive by default. <spem>mi vɪrɪθ</spem> means "I am running". If you want to communciate that you run in general, but aren't necessarily running now, use the <spem>el</spem> tense modifier: <spem>el mi vɪrɪθ</spem>.

	This also works with the past and future.  
	<spem>el ɑn mi vɪrɪθ</spem>: "I used to run".  
	<spem>el im mi vɪrɪθ</spem>: "I will get into running". A bit of a bad example, but the difference from <spem>im mi vɪrɪθ</spem> is that instead of just saying you plan to run, you're communicating that you're going to make it a regular thing.

	I call <spem>el</spem> the "vague tense" modifier.

* <spem>ɪr</spem> is the "close tense" modifier. <spem>ɪr ɑn mi vɪrɪθ</spem> means "I just ran", and <spem>ɪr im mi vɪrɪθ</spem> means "I'm about to run".

* <spem>ɑŋ</spem> is the "have done" tense, implying over the normal past that the action is still in effect.

* When you use <spem>ɑn</spem> or <spem>im</spem> to go into the past or the future, you *stay* in the past or future until you use <spem>eŋ</spem> to return to the present.

	<spem>ɑn mi vɪrɪθ, to ɪl tel ɪl verɪθ av mi, kyo mi gu vɪrɪθ. eŋ el mi teku.</spem> "I ran / was running, then he told me the truth, so I stopped running. Now(adays) I walk."

	This is partly for aesthetic reasons. It'd be ugly to have every sentence start with <spem>ɑn</spem> when telling a story. I also believe it saves more speed than it loses.

	If it helps you can think of it like this: "The following sequence of events happened: I run, then he tells me the truth, so I stop running." And you might notice that in English we sometimes do a similar thing when telling a story, especially when it's supposed to be amusing.

	This doesn't happen if you place a tense modifier before the verb instead of at the beginning of the sentence.

	<spem>mi ɑn zu A. kɑ ŋi zu B?</spem>. "I did A. Are you doing B?" <br> If it were <spem>ɑn mi zu A. kɑ ŋi zu B?</spem>, it would mean, "I did A. did you do B?"

* When using an explicit time-specifying expression, you don't need any tense modifiers. "I run yesterday" is perfectly clear and there's no need to add a syllable to move it to the past.

* You can double-use <spem>ɑn</spem> and <spem>im</spem> to get the "had happened" or (not very useful) "will be going to happen" tenses.

	<spem>ɑn mi ɑn humi kim ɪl lɪmɵl, kyo nu kei yɪm.</spem> "I had already drunk all the water, so I didn't have any."

	You can also do like this: "<spem>im ɑn mi humi ɪl lɪmɵl</spem>" - "I will have drunk the water". You're allowed to combine the tense modifiers in any way that makes sense.

* This should go without saying, but just incase, "is going to" should be translated the same way as "will".

**Open question:** my system for getting the double-past and double-future seems to lead to extreme ugliness if you want both layers to stick (meaning put both at the start). I don't think anyone wants to say "<spem>ɑn ɑn ...</spem>". This might not be a huge problem since the double-past is usually used in relation to the past, and so most of the time you'd probably only want one layer to stick (like I did in the example above). But is it still a problem?
