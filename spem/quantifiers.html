<p>
To use quantifier-type words like "always", "everywhere", "never", and "sometimes", use a quantifier prefix
and a type suffix.
</p>
<h3>Quantifier prefixes</h3>
<ul>
	<li><spem>ki</spem>: every-</li>
	<li><spem>mɑ</spem>: most</li>
	<li><spem>ze</spem>: some-</li>
	<li><spem>li</spem>: few</li>
	<li><spem>nu</spem>: no-</li>
</ul>
<h3>Type suffixes</h3>
<ul>
	<li><spem>ji</spem>: place (-where)</li>
	<li><spem>ti</spem>: time</li>
	<li><spem>pi</spem>: person (-one)</li>
	<li><spem>θi</spem>: case (used for place and time quantifiers when place and time aren't literal)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Examples:
</p>
<ul>
<li><spem>kiji</spem> = everywhere</li>
<li><spem>kipi</spem> = everyone</li>
<li><spem>nuti</spem> = never</li>
<li><spem>zeti</spem> = sometimes</li>
<li><spem>mɑθi</spem> = in most cases</li>
<li><spem>liθi</spem> = rarely</li>
<li><spem>liti</spem> = rarely (time being literal)</li>
</ul>
<p>
I'm not a fan of <spem>mɑ</spem> phonetically, especially the double bilabial consonant pair in
<spem>mɑpi</spem>. But <spem>m</spem> currently has a profile of more/most/majority and
<spem>ɑ</spem> a profile of vastness.
</p>
<p>
Also, yes, I realize that these meanings can all already be reached using words like <spem>kim dji</spem> = all
places, but I'm adding these two-letter compound versions for speed. I don't think it would work to just make
these versions the normal ones, because of phonetic collisions and words like "case" probably won't/shouldn't
be 1-syllable anyway.
</p><p>
Although actually, writing that I partially convinced myself I should look into that more. <spem>ki</spem> is
currently taken and I think both words are well-chosen, but maybe I could change one of them, and do that for
all the ones that would collide? Comment below if you have any thoughts.
