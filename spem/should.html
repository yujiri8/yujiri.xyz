TITLE Spem conlang: Should

TEMPLATE DEFAULT

<p>
"Should" has a lot of different meanings that aren't distinguished in any language I know of. Here are the
three I can pinpoint:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>
	Moral
</p></li><li><p>
	Strategic
</p></li><li><p>
	"False subject". This one is the vaguest, but here's an example: "Rey shouldn't have defeated Kylo in
	The Force Awakens". It's neither a moral nor a strategic should - at least, not one that applies to Rey.
	The statement it's actually making is that <i>the story would be better if this didn't happen</i>, in
	other words, Rey isn't the subject of the 'should'; the story or the writer is. Hence the name.
	</p><p>
	This is also used for jokes (X should have happened = it would've been funny if X had happened), general
	design (user interface consultant says "the button should be here" = "the interface is better if the button
	is here"), et cetera. The only consistent rule of this form seems to be that the grammatical subject
	is not the semantic subject.
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
Spem of course is going to separate all these. They're all used as combo verbs. Here they are so far:
</p>
<h2>Morals</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><spem>rɑ</spem> - "should": not doing it is morally reprehensible.
</p></li>
<li><p><spem>rɑi</spem> -
"shouldn't": doing it is morally reprehensible. Basically this can be thought of as a convenience
alias for <spem>rɑ nu</spem>.
</p></li>
<li><p><spem>ri</spem> -
The action is morally admirable, but not doing it is excusable.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Examples:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
	I should move it. = <spem>mi rɑ nɪv ɪl.</spem>
</p></li><li><p>
	I shouldn't move it. = <spem>mi rɑi nɪv ɪl.</spem>
</p></li><li><p>
	I <i>have</i> to move it. = <spem>mi tir rɑ nɪv ɪl.</spem>
</p></li><li><p>
	Ideally, / if I were a really great person, I'd move it. = <spem>mi ri nɪv ɪl.</spem>
</p></li><li><p>
	There's no reason I should move it. = <spem>mi nu rɑ nɪv ɪl.</spem>
</p></li><li><p>
	(I should, but) I don't <i>have</i> to move it... (it wouldn't be that bad if I didn't...) =
	<spem>mi nu tir rɑ nɪv ɪl...</spem> (eg: ideally one should sacrifice one's life in this situation,
	but can hardly be blamed for not doing so)
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
I'm not sure if I need to add one for "two-sided moral irrelevance". <spem>nu rɑ</spem> means it's perfectly okay
to not do something and <spem>nu rɑi</spem> means it's perfectly okay to do something, but I don't have a succinct
way to explicitly make both statements. I would add <spem>ro</spem> but that's taken. <spem>reu</spem> doesn't
sound that good. <spem>ru</spem> is another possibility, but that doesn't sound good when followed by <spem>nu</spem>.
Maybe <spem>rei</spem>.
</p>
<h2>Strategic, perfect information</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>
	<spem>zɑ</spem> - "should": doing it will promote the subject's goals
<!--	</p><p>
	Maybe, just to use the unused 1-syllable <i>z</i> space, I should have <spem>zɑi</spem> as a shortcut
	for <spem>tir zɑ</spem> and <spem>zau</spem> as a shortcut for <spem>zɑ nu</spem>. On that note maybe
	I should have <spem>rau</spem> for <spem>rɑ nu</spem>.
	</p>-->
</p></li><li><p>
	<spem>zɑi</spem> - "shouldn't": doing it will undermine the subject's goals
</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Strategic, given information</h2>
<p>
The perfect information strategic should words reference what would <i>actually</i> promote the subject's goals.
The given information variants reference what the subject, at the time, thought would be beneficial. Note that
these are aliases for "<spem>tu ke ni zɑ(i)</spem>".
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
	<spem>az</spem> - "should"
</p></li><li><p>
	<spem>ɑiz</spem> - "shouldn't"
</p</li>
</ul>

<h2>False subject</h2>
<p>
My tentative plan for this is to have the words <spem>wɑ</spem> (should) and <spem>wɑi</spem> (shouldn't),
which go at the beginning of the sentence, since that structure most accurately reflects the "it would be
better/worse if ..." that they designate. I'm not sure whether I should distinguish strategic and artistic
false subjects. Maybe <spem>hɑ</spem> or <spem>θa</spem> for one of them.
