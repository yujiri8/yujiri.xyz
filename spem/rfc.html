## The adjective/noun distinction

I've written a lot about this in [this comment](index?c=b465ef30-d61b-4db1-9ab4-3d245613d680#comment-section) and its subtree. In [this below comment](?c=bae2332d-cd41-4248-8fa5-e8104fd51773#comment-section), I started to change my mind.

## Directness

I need to deal with concepts of directness. In English, we often say things like "directly cause" drawing a relevant distinction between that and indirect causation. The distinctions *are* very important. I should probably have a different verb for that. I already spent <spem>zo</spem>, so maybe <spem>zyu</spem>?

There might also be a need for "directly say" or perhaps "indirectly say" while <spem>tel</spem> means directly say. Maybe <spem>tʌl</spem>.

## Quantifier problems

I've discussed this one in the comments on [quantifiers](quantifiers). I have no idea what a good approach is.

## Distinguishing "technically can" from "practically can"

These merit separate words. Currently, "can" is <spem>ve</spem>, and I would make the other one <spem>vye</spem>.
But which one should be which? Which is more common?

Update: I've [become very unsure that I should do this](?c=87485cb5-7063-4ea8-a64f-37b9c2c9adb7#comment-section).

## How do we distinguish "see someone doing X" from "see (evidence) that (at least) someone does X"?

Currently, I would translate both as <spem>kivu ke yɪm zu X</spem>.

It seems like we need a version of the current word <spem>ki</spem> that applies to clauses, whereas the current
one always binds with the next verb or entity word. I don't think it's good to use the same word for both of them
because that could lead to a lot of ambiguities.

On the other hand, maybe it's the former that should be rightfully translated as that, and I should change
the way I express the latter.

## Male and female

At some point, Spem needs one syllable words for male and female. Unfortunately I think I'm too biased to choose
the sounds that go into these. I want to get at least a few other opinions from other people who do not
have [irrational beliefs about the nature of gender](/protagonism/gender); at least one from a woman, and
preferably some from people whose native language is not English. (I realize how difficult that'll be for me
to find, but that's part of why I want to post the question before it's close to the most urgent thing on the list.)

My intuitions are to use <spem>f</spem> and perhaps <spem>m</spem> for female, and <spem>r</spem> and maybe
<spem>ŋ</spem> for male. But looking at that, it seems so blatantly derived from conservative gender norms and
the existing English word 'female' that I don't trust my intuition on this one. Of course, it's far from
impossible that those sounds really are the best ones to use, but considering that I'm male and generally think
the masculine side of said gender norms are a lot closer to how all people should act, I want other opinions.

## Emphasizing different sides of degree modifiers

There are pairs like "almost" versus "not quite"; or "slightly" versus "barely". Note that in either case they
designate the same degree but one emphasizes the positive side and the other emphasizes the negative side.
Currently Spem doesn't do separate words for this. Arguably, <spem>nur</spem> should be understood as "slightly"
and "barely" should be conveyed with <spem>neni nur</spem>. But I feel it's a problem that I can't currently convey
the meaning of English "partially" in the positive sense, because <spem>nor</spem> specifically means a *medium*
degree, whereas partially covers anything that isn't complete; and <spem>nu kir</spem> emphasizes the negative side.

This is very similar to the question of whether "but" should exist - it means the same thing as "and" (that both
statements are true), but implies a notion that the two are in contrast. I hate the word on principle because that
"contrast" is such a vague idea and there are so many ways to use it to create harmful ambiguities. But maybe
it's too useful to not have. I don't know. I haven't thought much about "flow control" words like that, but I'm
attracted to the idea of having different sentence-linking conjunctions to specify what the relationship between
the sentences is supposed to be (for example, one that means the preceding is a sort of preface to the following).
I just don't like *this* one. But maybe any kind of word like that would have this problem, and I'd see it with
the others if I used them for a while.
