DESC History is one long story of failed and murderous governments, but somehow the lack of historical precedents is an argument against anarchism?

The ["AnArChY wOnT WoRk BeCaUsE tHeRe ArE nO hIsToRiCaL eXaMpLeS!"](https://youtu.be/WxPOAl4sBUQ?t=390) argument is not only an [appeal to tradition fallacy](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/44/Appeal-to-Tradition) and creates a self-fulfilling prophecy, it's also a complete boomerang like every other argument against [Anarchism](anarchism).

If you want to argue Anarchy has never been tried, then it has never failed just as much as it has never succeeded. Anarchy has a neutral track record. All forms of government that have been tried have 100% failure track records. How many times has democracy, or republic, or any other form of goverment, been tried? Can anyone name a single example that did NOT turn totalitarian even by a statist's judgement and spill enormous amounts of innocent blood?

[American conservatives](left_right) are likely to argue: "America worked well, at least at first". Let's assume it's valid to argue that because there was a democracy that started out well before turning increasingly oppressive, therefore democracy works. Let's disregard the fact that *that would still be an argument for anarchism* because if true it shows even a well-founded minarchist country turning oppressive. At what point in time was America ever a country of justice and liberty?

Is it the more modern years, when [government regulation increasingly burdens the economy](market) and has turned it into an outright corporatist "market" where the government <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-governments-are-giving-billions-in-tax-breaks-to-apple-amazon-and-other-tech-giants-2016-10-13">funds</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.siliconvalleywatcher.com/googles-billions-in-internet-subsidies/">businesses</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://qz.com/1145669/googles-true-origin-partly-lies-in-cia-and-nsa-research-grants-for-mass-surveillance/">they</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Google">like</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/obama-google-facebook-would-not-exist-without-government-funding">with</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jul/02/us-cities-and-states-give-big-tech-93bn-in-subsidies-in-five-years-tax-breaks">billions</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.precursorblog.com/content/how-much-should-google-be-subsidized">of</a> dollars [extorted](enforcement) from taxpayers and then use the claim that these corporations are still "private businesses" to justify their acts of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOByUDv1ftQ">political</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/about/policies/#community-guidelines">censorship</a>? (That last link is Youtube's community guidelines. I don't even need a specific example; they outright say they'll censor content that criticizes [lifestyle choices they feel defensive about](gender).)

America was never a country of justice or liberty. It's been a horror show all along. Constitution-worshipping conservatives need to drop their delusions.
