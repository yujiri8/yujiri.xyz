Rape culture is real, it's just not where most people think it is. We live in a society where you're allowed to rape a certain class of people. Some might even say you abuse them by not raping them.

Parents rape their children all the time. Probably every day. It's all done under the guise of "hygiene", like baths or diaper changing. These acts involve touching someone else's intimate parts and are often done as they scream no. Everyone would call it rape if did them to an adult without consent. The excuse given for raping children is literally "for their good". Sound like ["they enjoyed it"](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotIfTheyEnjoyedItRationalization)? Because that's what it is - a claim that your victim is somehow better off for being raped.

One wonders if these people would accept the same excuse for raping an adult who doesn't understand germs.

Maybe part of the reason people don't see it as rape is because the rapist doesn't derive sexual pleasure? But that doesn't matter to the victim.

Almost all parents are rapists. Probably even most "anarchist" parents. Of course, people will send me death threats for saying [it's okay to have consensual sex with a teenager](age_of_consent)... but those same people rape their own children and consider themselves righteous. You're all a bunch of hypocrite monsters with no rights.

What, you thought there would be comments on this page? So you could tell me how rape is okay? You expected free real estate on my server? There's nothing to say. If you support rape culture, I couldn't care less about you.
