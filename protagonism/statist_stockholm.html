<p>
If you spend time as an <a href="anarchism">Anarchist</a> debating with statists, you might be shocked at how
people gladly worship their oppressors and <a href="altruism_examples">the</a>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/edvstx/statist_retard_story_of_the_day/">insane</a>
<a href="voting_consent">fallacies</a> they come up with to defend them. Their behavior can only be explained
by <a href="stockholm_syndrome">Stockholm syndrome</a>.
</p><p>
A sparkling example is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIT3xnYbmzQ">this song</a>, which was
<a href="http://www.burtfolsom.com/?p=3025">used by the US government during World War 2 as a propaganda tool</a>,
and is about how great it feels to pay taxes. Holy fuck.
</p><p>
It feels <i>sooo</i> great to increase the amount of money I'm giving to someone who's going to
<a href="/protagonism/enforcement">fucking put</a> me
<a href="/protagonism/imprisonment">in jail</a> if I don't.
If the Mafia or ISIS took over the country they'd commission similar songs to indoctrinate us to worship them.
