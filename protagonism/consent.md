DESC Just because something is foolish or even immoral does NOT entail that it's justified to PREVENT it.

One of the deepest problems in the world is the loss of the concept of consent.

Just because something is foolish or even immoral *does not* entail that it's justified to *prevent* it. There is a huge gap there. You just can't go from "it would be better if everyone did X", or even "everyone *should* do X", to "we should *make* everyone do X". Consent means nothing unless it means that you must allow others to make foolish and even immoral choices. If you don't believe in doing that, you quite literally don't believe in consent.

The most revealing form of this is the way American ["liberals"](left_right) talk about their designs for the world. I hear them ask "what are the *pros and cons* of (forcing people to do) X", and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTwPHuE_HrU">"to even out wealth, we should tax it"</a>, and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/74dvaz/cmv_the_united_states_should_have_mandatory/">"mass slavery would have three main benefits"</a>. They phrase things from an impersonal perspective, as if there's no such thing as something that's *not your decision*.

And then they go on Youtube and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGoWLWS4-kU">rant about consent</a>, like they have any right to talk about such a thing.

I once explained to a liberal man that drivers' licenses are tyranny because it's evil to [use violence against people](enforcement) for no other crime than driving without your approval. His response: "Well, I don't know if we can just get rid of that whole system... I'd wanna see some certification before I let someone drive." To him, all decisions are his. If he thinks it would be safer, it's just automatically justified to impose it on *other* people, no matter how much cruelty it takes to enforce it.

The worst part of it all is their insistence that [child slavery](children) is good for children. A 2020 DNC candidate [unironically advocated putting parents in jail for *truancy*](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/31/kamala-harris-laughed-jailing-parents-truancy). The same one who in the debates raged about pro-lifers wanting to "control women's bodies".

Hell, even [my early philosophies](anarchism_conversion) were influenced by this! I was a "Chaos Anarchist" before what I am now, where I basically imagined a society with a weak concept of property and everyone would [fight and take from others](moral_conflict) to get the resources to accomplish what they [thought was right](conscience). I had been trained to undervalue [property rights](property) - in other words, to undervalue consent.
