<p>
People who think that "life" - defined to include life in <a href="imprisonment">incarceration</a> or similar
states - is sacred for its own sake have completely lost sight of what's good about life. These people <i>don't</i>
value what's actually good about life so they have to make up an artificial special case for it to make their moral
system align with their pacifist judgements.
</p><p>
Life is <a href="metaphysics">a two-way causal link between a person and the universe</a>, such that the person
can affect their environment and be affected by it. Life is only valuable because it's necessary for the things we
actually value, both <a href="virtues">moral values</a> and <a href="emotions">amoral happiness</a>.
</p><p>
A person sentenced to life imprisonment is dead. They just aren't allowed to accept their death and leave.
And they certainly aren't allowed to reform if they were actually a criminal and make
<a href="property">restitution</a>; no, they're forced
to spend the rest of their "life" eating food procured by the <a href="anarchism">taxation of the innocent</a>.
It's a disgusting way of destroying someone's soul while forcing them to stick around in their body.
</p><p>
There's nothing magically immoral about killing; it's not inhumane or anything. It's just
<a href="forms_of_punishment">the best way to deal with a criminal whose crime is serious and can't be made
to perform restitution</a>.
