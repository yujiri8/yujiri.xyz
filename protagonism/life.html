People who think that "life" - defined to include life in [incarceration](imprisonment) or similar states - is sacred for its own sake have completely lost sight of what's good about life. These people *don't* value what's actually good about life so they have to make up an artificial special case for it to make their moral system align with their pacifist judgements.

Life is [a two-way causal link between a person and the universe](metaphysics), such that the person can affect their environment and be affected by it. Life is only valuable because it's necessary for the things we actually value, both [moral values](virtues) and [amoral happiness](emotions).

A person sentenced to life imprisonment is dead. They just aren't allowed to accept their death and leave. And they certainly aren't allowed to reform if they were actually a criminal and make [restitution](property); no, they're forced to spend the rest of their "life" eating food procured by the [taxation of the innocent](anarchism). It's a disgusting way of destroying a soul while forcing them to stick around in their body.

There's nothing magically immoral about killing; it's not inhumane or anything. It's just [the best way to deal with a criminal whose crime is serious and can't be made to perform restitution](forms_of_punishment).
