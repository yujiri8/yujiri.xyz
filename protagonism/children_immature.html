<p>
The perception's common that small children are extremely immature and entitled. They cry whenever they don't get
everything they want, even when it's <!--<a href="parents">-->not something they're entitled to<!--</a>-->! What selfish
behavior! Or is it?
</p><p>
As adults, we have a biased perspective because we know about things they don't.
We've seen what's in the world. We work, see horrible atrocities going on all over the place, and whatnot.
But children <i>don't know that those things exist</i>. They've never <i>seen</i> anything but play
(well, and <a href="children">abuse</a>).
They legitimately don't know what it means to have a job, or to have to work for food. From their perspective,
there <i>is</i> nothing else in life than getting things they want. It's literally the most important
thing in the world by elimination. So why not cry about it?
</p><p>
The real maturity is to recognize when another person doesn't see what you see, and to judge them from their
own perspective.
