TITLE The Pragmatic Downsides of Government

<p>
It's easy enough to point out how <a href="anarchism">governments are criminal organizations with no basis for their
authority</a>, and usually a statist's reply isn't to contend with those arguments (they're too obviously correct) but to argue
that government is somehow necessary. (Nevermind the <a href="consequentialism">consequentialism</a> required for that argument,
which many of those same people disavow if asked directly.) I already shot down that idea in the same article. In this article I
just want to point out some additional pragmatic downsides of government, or at least of democracy.

<li><p><b>It encourages discrimination</b>. Let me ask a question: what should you expect to happen if you take a society with an imbalance of superficial traits - skin color, for example - and erect a system where every conflict is decided by who has more votes? Should you be surprised when the minority ends up with less rights?</p><p>
The only reason this doesn't seem to be happening in modern-day America is because our culture is counteracting it so hard with anti-discrimination to the point of forced equality and <a href="discrimination.html">expanding discrimination to cover non-superficial traits as well</a>. Not to mention the <a href="/protagonism/left_right">liberal</a> (pun intended) use of censorship.
It definitely was the case in America's past - black people couldn't even vote, so they didn't have <i>any</i> recourse to dig themselves out of their situation.
<!--The reason is that every group whose members are driven by self-interest (which most people in the world primarily are) and is completely unaccountable to anyone outside itself will discriminate against those who bear some superficial dissimilarity to the people inside the
group. For an example of why this is, consider the following: there is a country populated by both black and white people but happens to be governed by mostly white ones. The goverment decides to raise taxes on black people, because the more taxes black people pay, the less white people have to pay to keep the
government's wealth constant, and most of the senators are white, and "most people" is all that matters in a democracy. (The effect is stronger in a republic like America's where government officials are not themselves exempt from the law (supposedly), so they want to make the laws favor their own demographic.)<br>
And you might argue that it'd be far easier for them to just give a tax break to government employees since that seems a lot easier to argue for, but suppose they already did that to the point where it's ridiculous and no one in the country can be
convinced that government employees should pay less taxes. They would then look for a superficial trait that most of them share to draw lines with. Any existing racism in the country would be a huge help to them, so they would try to foster it.-->

<li><p><b>It encourages dishonesty and <a href="/argument/dirty_tactics">dirty argument tactics</a></b>. Because it makes convincing the masses the sole means of political power, anything that helps you convince someone is something you're incentivized to do, even if it works by exploiting their irrationality.</p><p>
Now, obviously, this happens to some extent in any system. But in an Anarchy this only gives you economic power, not more power over a monopoly on violence.</p><p>
And that's not even to mention how it makes civility in disagreement far less likely since anyone who's voting for something you're voting against is directly contributing to the violation of your rights.
</p></li>
<li><p><b>It divides people who really belong on the same side into arbitrary groups, creating needless conflict</b>. This one is really sad. You might be a Japanese soldier in World War 2 and have no problem with the culture and individuals of America, but if "your country" decides to make war on theirs, you have to kill them. I have an idea for a short novel I want to
make about two soldiers in opposing countries that go to war with each other. They talk, and realize they should be on the same side, and end up both murdered by their own governments for refusing to kill their friend.
</p></li>
<li><p><b>It makes bribery massively more powerful.</b> Imagine that I live in an Anarchy and I want someone in power to do something corrupt that costs a million dollars. How much do I have to pay him? A million dollars because I'm asking him to spend a million dollars, assuming he has neither a personal stake in it nor any moral qualms<!--(which I should note is an inbalanced condition - he could have a personal stake in either direction, but moral qualms would only apply to something evil, so it's actually more likely than not that I have to pay him well more than a million)-->. So bribery doesn't really do much in an Anarchy. At best it allows me to obfuscate my involvement. But what if I live under a government and I want to bribe an official to do something that costs a million dollars? In this case, I don't need to pay her a million dollars, because I'm not asking her to do it with her own money. It's taxpayer money and it's not like she can just pocket it and go home. Since she's not personally paying the cost, I might be able to bribe her with just a thousand dollars. Clearly, bribery is far more powerful under a government.

I got this argument from <a href="https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/Libertarian%20Anarchism%20Responses%20to%20Ten%20Objections_2.pdf">Roderick T. Long's pdf</a>. It's a pretty good read in its own right, but I thought this point was so interesting I wanted to include right here.
