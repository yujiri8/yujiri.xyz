<p>
It's 2019 November 15. Something happened yesterday I have to write about, as much as I wish I didn't.
</p><p>
I was in a bookstore for a Spanish conversation meetup and I saw a man strike his child. The kid couldn't have
been older than six. Fucking monster.
</p><p>
It looked like the kid fell. He was on the ground. And then got hit by his dad when he got back up.
</p><p>
I knew I should've done something. I should've run over and hit that man. I should have kicked his ass.
If I saw him do it in public he must've done it thousands of times.
</p><p>
I wasn't surprised at myself for being too cowardly. There were dozens of people there. I couldn't have been the
only one who noticed. But it's not like I would've needed to overpower the man or anything. If I had've just punched
him, that would've fucking made a statement that it's not acceptable to hit innocent people. Everyone in the building
would've remembered the event, and they'd think about it next time they were bystanders to this.
</p><p>
It might've been easier to yell at the monster but not retaliate. But if I'd done that,
all the other people in my group would remember me as the person who was too cowardly to
stick up for the innocent, and worse, they wouldn't see it that way - they'd see it as me having an emotional outburst
in public that overcame "better" judgement.
</p><p>
But also, that wouldn't have been that useful. The problem is that not one person in a room full of adults
stuck up for the kid. If I use words and not my fists, I'm sending the message that the solution to violence is to
ask the attacker to stop. And that's wrong. That belief is why this kind of problem will never be solved.
That's the mindset behind <a href="anarchism">voting</a>, and everything. I still should've done that
over nothing, though!
</p><p>
I watched an innocent child get violently assaulted in public and did fucking nothing. I actively made the situation
worse, by contributing to <a href="/argument/fee_bystander">the bystander effect</a>. If anyone else
noticed and recognized this socially acceptable violence for what it is, I was one more person in the room turning a
blind eye, setting a bad example, making it harder to do anything.
</p><p>
That's how I am. That's how this world is. <a href="children">Kids are property and no one gives a fuck</a>.
