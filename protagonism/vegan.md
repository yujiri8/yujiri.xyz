The reason I'm titling this page with "should be" is that I'm not following my obligation here. But this page is just to explain why it's my obligation.

[Metaphysics](metaphysics) make it clear that believing in consciousness without free is nonsensical and unjustifiable. This is the universally accepted theory of animals, but since it's necessarily irrational, I realize there are two possibilities:

1. Animals don't have consciousness.

2. Animals have free will and rights.

I can't judge the relative probability of these. They don't seem to act like people, but they also seem too close to be naturally occurring robots. If you sincerely think the probability of #2 is so low tht it's okay to eat meat, then I don't blame you, and I think a reasonable person can think that. But I don't see it that way. For me the probability is about 50/50, so for me, killing an animal is half as bad as murder.

There are other complexities, and I'm not covering them all here. I will link [Michael Huemer's piece](https://philpapers.org/archive/HUEDOE.pdf).

I believed this for years before I became vegetarian, and I still haven't turned vegan, purely because of moral weakness.
