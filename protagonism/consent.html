MARKDOWN

One of the deepest problems in the world is the loss of the concept of Consent.

Just because something is foolish or even immoral *does not* entail that it's justified to *prevent* it. There is a huge gap there, a huge unjustified leap. You just can't go from "it would be better if everyone did X", or even "everyone *should* do X", to "we should make everyone do X". Consent means nothing unless it means that one must allow others to make foolish or even immoral choices. If you don't believe in doing that, you quite literally don't believe in consent.

[Leftists](left_right) often <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGoWLWS4-kU">rant about consent</a>, but the irony is even more bitter than it is with conservatives. Leftists support [even more taxes and regulations](consent), and [even more](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/31/kamala-harris-laughed-jailing-parents-truancy) [child slavery](children). They barely have any concept of consent left!

They're always talking how we need to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTwPHuE_HrU">*even out* wealth</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/25/uk-leader-corbyn-to-amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-just-pay-your-taxes.html">*fix* the *inequality*</a>, it's <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/07/16/bernie-sanders-on-americas-grotesquely-unfair-society/">*not fair*</a> that some people have billions of dollars while others struggle. According to them, if one person has more than others, that's a problem, period. They can scarcely fathom the idea that what you acquire peacefully *belongs* to you, and you're *entitled* to possess it to the exclusion of everyone else.

Hell, even [my early philosophies](anarchism_conversion) were influenced by this! I was a "Chaos Anarchist" before what I am now, where I basically imagined a society with a weak concept of property and everyone would [fight and take from others](moral_conflict) to get the resources to accomplish what they [thought was right](conscience). I had been trained to undervalue property rights - in other words, to undervalue consent.

Another shining example is [Elizabeth Warren talking about how "for the rich, costs will go up"](https://youtu.be/4Hxa893LFlU?t=8). Even the language she uses reflects this depravity. She uses "costs" as the subject of the sentence, as if it's somehing that's just going to "happen" as opposed to her enforcing it. To her, it doesn't matter who something "belongs" to; she just has the right to *enforce* anything that *would be better*, because, [like all statists](anarchism), she doesn't value Consent.

I once explained to a liberal man why drivers' licenses are tyranny because it's unjustified for the government to [use violence against people](enforcement) for no other crime than driving without their approval. His response: "Well, I don't know if we can just get rid of that whole system... I'd wanna see some certification before I let someone drive." He doesn't need to consider who's being affected or bother with consent. It's just automatically justified to impose something on *other* people because *he* feels safer that way, and any act enforcing it is automatically justified, no matter how cruel.
