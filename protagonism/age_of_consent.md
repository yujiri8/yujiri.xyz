DESC Ironically, enforcing an "age of consent" requires violating consent.

Most people of any ideology uphold some idea of an "age of consent": an age before which a person is supposedly unable to consent to certain types of interaction and those acts should be prevented even if the "victim" wants to do them.

I've had this argument a lot, and the main explanation I get is "a child can't consent to sex because they can't understand the implications of that act". If that's how consent works then I can also argue:

* You don't actually consent to buying product X, you're just too economically illiterate to know that it's not good for you. It should be illegal and the people who try to sell it to you should be punished to protect you.

* Recreational drug use should be illegal because it causes medical issues and most of the people who use them only do so out of ignorance of the risks, so they aren't really consenting;

* Unhealthy eating should be illegal because it causes medical issues and most of the people who do it only do so out of ignorance of the risks, so they aren't really consenting;

* Kids wasting their childhood on games (like I did mine) should be illegal because they'll deeply regret it for the rest of their life and they only do it because they don't realize that, so they're not really consenting to playing games;

* Learning [Haskell](/software/haskell) as your [first programming language](/computing/why_program) should be illegal because it's a bad choice and the only reason you'd do it is if you didn't know that, in which case you're not really consenting. It should be legally required to learn something like [Python](/computing/python) or [Go](/computing/go) first. This constitutes protecting programmers' consent!

Obviously that's not how consent works. Consent is only invalid if it's obtained through deception or threats; just not having relevant information doesn't invalidate it.

I find it telling that *all* the people I argue with about this draw the magic line at 18. I guess it's just a coincidence that that's the number chosen by the government that [oppresses them](anarchism)? But they don't *always* draw it there - sometimes, when talking about a case that happened in a state where the legal age was 17, *the same person who normally draws it at 18* thinks 17 year olds can consent. And these are mostly [Ancaps](/argument/faction_ancap) I'm talking about!

Be honest. If you believe in this, are you *sure* you're not getting it from the government? What do you think of past societies where marriage long before 18 was normal? Were all of those people rapists?

I also want to raise the spectrum problem: if it were actually about either information or emotional maturity, then not only would it not be bound to a constant age, but it *couldn't be a hard line* because information and emotional maturity don't work that way.

A common response is to admit that the age chosen is arbitrary, but say we have to choose one as a practical matter (because [god forbid it's not a hard line](https://fakenous.net/?p=1529). Most people are not prepared to confront the concept of gradient consent). But when you respond to an argument about legitimacy with an argument about practicality, the most you can be arguing for is that having a hard line age of consent is [an evil means justified by its results](consequentialism) - otherwise, you'd be committing the appeal to consequences fallacy. And that's not how any of the people I argue with see it.

The irony here is that it's actually the enforcement of an "age of consent" that violates children's consent, since it initiates force to take away their choice.

Now, people often fill in strawmen when I make this argument. It's important to keep in mind that [deliberate deception is equivalent to force](https://yujiri.xyz/protagonism/property#lying-as-a-non-peaceful-act). Children generally trust adults to an extreme (and may also perceive implicit threats in this type of situation which obviously invalidate consent). I am sure that in practice, most pedophilic relationships are coercive, and I'll gladly join in socially punishing the perpetrators of even the ones that aren't. But it *is* possible for a child to consent.

But I think this is actually a really serious issue because of how far it's taken. It's not just a case where people are wrong about ethics. Almost every Ancap I know thinks people who have sex with a 17 year old should be *killed*. It's unbelievable how unanimous it is, and how grossly against voluntaryist principles. You can post horrific memes about feeding people into woodchippers for saying "MAP rights" in Ancap communities and you will never get a negative reaction.

It's terrifying. Are Ancaps actually going to murder a whole bunch of people when we finally get that voluntary world?
