There are a few miscellaneous pecularities about the way emotions work that I'm making this article to explain.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
	<p>
	The first thing I want to talk about is a few factors besides the magnitude of the trigger that affect the magnitude of
	emotions:
	</p>
	<ol>
	<li><p>
	<b>Temporal distance</b>: The magnitude of a feeling is inversely proportional to the temporal distance from the event
	that triggered it - that is, they gradually drop off until you fully move on.
	</p></li><li><p>
	<b>Causal distance</b>: The magnitude of a feeling is inversely proportional to the causal distance from the event that
	triggered it (if applicable). If someone dies across the world, it's bound to affect you much less than someone dying
	right in front of you, even if both are complete strangers. Worth saying is that this is not only natural and inevitable
	but morally right.
	</p><p>
	Sometimes people who don't understand this feel the need to try to correct their feelings, thinking that they're
	insensitive for not being moved by tragedies across the world. They're not.
	</p></li><li><p>
	One factor that actually isn't its own: <b>probability</b>. It might seem that emotions are stronger when the event that
	triggers them is less expected. But I think this effect is actually emergent: if you were told something was likely to
	happen beforehand, you felt the partial-certainty form of the emotion already, and the magnitude likely dropped off, so
	when the full event comes, it's only changing what you had already accepted as going to happen by half as much.
	</p></li><li><p>
	<b>Limitation</b>: For emotions triggered by external world events, there's either some sort of logarithmic scaling or
	it's outright capped after a certain point. Maybe both. Because seeing an entire planet get blown up wouldn't cause any
	kind of severe emotional trauma to most people.
	</p></li>
	</ol>

	The concept of "caring". Many emotions (self-pity, humbling, loneliness for examples) are inherent to human nature and
	feeling them is beyond our direct control (though you can still sometimes reason yourself out of them - aka convincing
	yourself that the trigger isn't as big a deal as you thought). But others (such as sympathy and anger), since their
	triggers are external world events that we may or may not care about, are actually voluntary - we can choose whether we
	experience them. This is morally admirable; it is <a href="impurity">choosing to revere your values over your own
	happiness</a>. Though exaggerating the magnitude would not count since that would be akin to for example overpunishing
	someone for a small crime.
	</p>

</li>

	The concept of "shadowing". You can experience a diminished form of an emotion through certain means other than its
	actual trigger. Works of art, in particular, whether stories, music, poetry, or something else, contain bottled emotions
	that are experienced when the work of art is. That's why art is so powerful and so important to every culture. It's
	actually what defines art if you ask me.
	</p><p>
	Curiously, it seems like you can also do it to some extent by simply imagining the trigger. For example, I very often
	entertain imaginary conversations with real or hypothetical people where I explain what I'm thinking about and they
	mostly just listen and acknowledge. This is me shadowing <a href="emotions">companionship</a>.
