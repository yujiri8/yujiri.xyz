The <a href="https://youtu.be/WxPOAl4sBUQ?t=390">"AnArChY wOnT WoRk BeCaUsE tHeRe ArE nO hIsToRiCaL eXaMpLeS!"</a>
argument is not only an
<a href="https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/44/Appeal-to-Tradition">appeal to
tradition fallacy</a> and creates a self-fulfilling prophecy, it's also a complete boomerang like every other argument
against <a href="anarchism">Anarchism</a>.
</p><p>
If you want to argue Anarchy has never been tried, then it has never failed just as much as it has never succeeded.
Anarchy has a neutral track record. All forms of government that have been tried have 100% failure track records.
How many times has democracy, or republic, or any other form of goverment, been tried? Can anyone name a single
example that did NOT turn totalitarian even by a statist's judgement and spill enormous amounts of innocent blood?
</p><p>
<a href="left_right">American conservatives</a> are likely to argue: "America worked well, at least at first".
Let's assume it's valid to argue that because there was a democracy that started out well before turning increasingly
oppressive, therefore democracy works. Let's disregard the fact that <i>that would still be an argument for
anarchism</i> because if true it shows even a well-founded minarchist country turning oppressive. At what
point in time was America ever a country of justice and liberty?

America was never a country of justice or liberty. It's been a horror show all along. Constitution-worshipping
conservatives need to drop their delusions.
