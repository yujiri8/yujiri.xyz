If you spend time as an [Anarchist](anarchism) debating with statists, you might be shocked at how people gladly worship their oppressors and [the](altruism_examples) [insane](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/edvstx/statist_retard_story_of_the_day/)
[fallacies](voting_consent) they come up with to defend them. Their behavior can only be explained by [Stockholm syndrome](stockholm_syndrome).

A sparkling example is [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIT3xnYbmzQ), which was [used by the US government during World War 2 as a propaganda tool](http://www.burtfolsom.com/?p=3025), and is about how great it feels to pay taxes. Holy fuck.

It feels *sooo* great to increase the amount of money I'm giving to someone who's going to [fucking put](/protagonism/enforcement) me [in jail](/protagonism/imprisonment) if I don't. If the Mafia or ISIS took over the country they'd commission similar songs to indoctrinate us to worship them.
