NAV Traditions of lying: Santa Claus and April Fools
DESC Lying is wrong no matter how socially accepted it is, and the harm goes deeper than you realize.

## April Fools

I suspect a lot of people who are hurt by the lies told on April Fools are held back from expressing their upset because they know nonconsent won't be respected anyway. Most people don't see [lying as the aggressive act it is](property#lying-as-a-consent-violation), so giving explicit nonconsent wouldn't stop them, and of course, that would make the problem worse. I know I've experienced this effect.

## Santa Claus

Besides the immorality of lying, one problem with Santa Claus that doesn't get enough attention is the moral double standard applied to Santa himself. He is so powerful that he not only knows the behavioral record of every child in the world, but is able to supply and deliver presents for each one of them, yet he never appears anywhere else. There are no legends of him using his massive power for any purpose beside this, such as feeding the homeless of stopping false convictions (he knows everyone's behavioral record!). A being of enormous power that refrains from using it to help the least fortunate. Wait a minute, does this sound familiar?

It's exactly like the Judeo-Christian idea of God! Many atheists point this out against God, but not against Santa.

If you tell your children the Santa Claus lie, you are teaching them in their most vulnerable years that [those with massive power are not to be held to the same moral standards as oneself](anarchism).

I also think that the expectation of regular gifts is harmful because it fosters entitlement, but this is less important.

One thing that's just astonishing about this is the irony of parents telling their kids the Santa Claus lie, and then complaining when they don't receive obedience. Maybe if you didn't lie to make them think they owe you less than they do, they'd be more grateful?!? Fucking morons.
