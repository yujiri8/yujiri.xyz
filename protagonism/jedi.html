<p>
I'm putting this article under Protagonism even though it only exists because I raise this point in <a href="/reviews/star_wars">my critique of Star Wars</a>, since it's a moral analysis rather than a storytelling critique. Anyway, here's why the Jedi are far from the perfect heroes they're portrayed to be, and arguably even more bad than good:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The Jedi support <a href="/protagonism/anarchism">statism</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The Jedi forbid <a href="/protagonism/retribution">revenge</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2GN_jM1DuI">ironic</a> since they support a government, and all governments take revenge).</p></li>
<li><p>My main criticism of the Jedi order's spirituality would be the way it seems to revolve around the suppression of emotion. Emotions are a beautiful part of human nature, and while it's true they can be a source of temptation, they can also be a source of motivation. Anger, shame, sympathy, and many
others can inspire a person to stick their neck out to fight evil, seek self-improvement, or make sacrifices for the less fortunate. Even if you don't believe in retribution, anger can at least help ward off fear.</p></li>
<li><p>The Jedi have a chain of command. This is senseless in a religious order based on a static creed.</p></li>
<li><p>The Jedi forbid romance. This stems from their suspicion of emotion, and so, my same argument applies. There's no reason a Protagonist mage warrior would be forbidden from partaking in reproduction.</p></li>
</ol>
