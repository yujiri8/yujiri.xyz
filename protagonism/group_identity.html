<p>
If I had to say what the single biggest problem is with the world, I'd say "group identity".
</p><p>
The definition of group identity is, "You're not fundamentally an individual but part of a group". This is the thinking at the
heart of all of the following evils:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
Communism: The people exist not as individuals but as parts of a nation, so we have to force them to pool everything and
individuals shouldn't be allowed to keep the fruits of their labor.
</p></li><li><p>
<a href="anarchism">Democracy</a>: "We The People" made this law; therefore everyone who's part of "We The People"
should be <a href="enforcement">violently forced</a> to comply even if they voted against it and
<a href="voting_consent">never consented</a> to this system.
</p></li><li><p>
<a href="left_right">Leftist</a> identity politics: "White people are the dominant group and racial minorities are
victims! Therefore every member of a minority race is a victim and every white person is part of the kyriarchy!"
</p></li><li><p>
Species conservatism: "It's the last of its kind! It deserves to be specially protected even though it's just a single
	animal, because if we lose it we're losing <i>an entire species</i>! Nevermind that the species is already effectively
	gone from the ecosystem!"
</p></li><li><p>
Arguments for the existence of <a href="leftist_economics">the wage gap</a> and similar conclusions:
"Women on average make less than men, therefore there's discrimination!" Any such gap is almost certainly due to women
working fewer hours on average (because they spend more time raising the children on average), choosing to work in lower-paying fields, et cetera. Since there are so many such factors
you'd have to account for to draw a valid conclusion about discrimination on a societal scale from this kind of data, said
kind of data <a href="/argument/statistics">is almost entirely useless</a>. If people thought about individuals instead
of groups defined by superficial traits, they wouldn't be so keen to commit this kind of fallacy.
</p></li>
</ul>
