TITLE When Discrimination Is Good
NAV When Discrimination Is Good
DESC "Discrimination" based on traits like religion is completely different from discrimination baed on superficial traits.

"Discrimination" is a word often defined in such a broad way that it isn't necessarily bad. Treating people differently based on a superficial trait is bullshit, but some people use the word to cover non-superficial traits too, such as religion. A person's religion is not only a choice, it's anything but an amoral choice. Since religions make claims about how people should act, obviously one religion can be morally better than another. And treating everyone "equally" is actually wrong if they're morally different. (Instead, we should treat everyone *according to the same rules*.) So actually, it's not just acceptable but can even be admirable to refuse to do business with someone based on their religion, if their religion is morally repulsive.

Ideology is the only actually *good* basis for discrimination, but there are some others that are often treated as equivalent to totally baseless ones like racism and sexism, but aren't; namely sexual orientation and gender identity, because while attraction and gender dysphoria aren't choices, actually having sex or asking other people to change the words they use *is*. If something is a choice, it can be criticized. I'm not saying that these choices *are* wrong, just that it's possible to believe they're wrong, whereas it's impossible believe that being a different ethnicity is wrong.
