TITLE Protagonism: Impurity

There are two things I place under the [value category](virtues) of Purity, as I'm pretty sure they're facets of the the same thing. The first type is what you might call "irreverence": it's deplorable to indulge in the midst of evil. For example, your conscience will object to you slouching or eating candy while receiving news of the death of a good person. The repugnance is probably extremely strong even though you can't explain it. And I know you'll object that this is just an emotional association. But that's exactly the point: doing this degrades, *to you*, what you care about. The emotional association is not cultural; it's intrinsic human nature.

The other subcategory is pleasures that my conscience has convinced me are impure even outside of solemn circumstances. These include pornography, masturbation, prostitution, and any type of masochistic fetish such as in BDSM.

The common thread between all those things is the reduction of a person's body - the most sacred object imaginable <span class="note">the only sacred object</span> - to a tool for sensory pleasure. That's why the facets of it culminate in BDSM, the most explicit form. A person's body is supposed to be the center of rights and autonomy and power. Something you don't touch without a reason, [even in a non-injurious way](/argument/propaganda#harm-hurt-violence). Certainly not the intimate parts. The definition of impurity is to degrade this sacredness by putting it down for sensory pleasure. Even though pornography doesn't involve physical contact, it still degrades it in your mind, just like irreverence does.

Masochism, by the way, is often misexplained as the enjoyment of pain. That's not what it is. It's the enjoyment of subjugation. I know from experience.

I still don't understand why masochism is pleasurable. It seems like it's not itself a sensory pleasure, but also isn't an emotion, because it doesn't have an opposite. But I am certain that it's evil.
