TITLE The Prime Emotions
NAV Emotions
TEMPLATE DEFAULT

<p>
After much philosophy, I've identified 16 prime emotions, not counting the negatives separately. Note that I'm not done with this - I'm sure this isn't entirely right, but it's close, and someday I'll understand it all. Also note that I had to fudge the English language a bit, even to the point of outright reusing names, because English was not invented by philosophers.
</p><p>
(Note that the "future-minded" emotions like fear and excitement are actually reducible to these; they're just the partial-certainty forms: if you think there's a 50% chance that something upsetting will happen, you'll experience half the upset.)</p>

<b>Footnote on Empowerment/Disempowerment</b>: This encompasses the pleasure of physical exercise, but also things like the powerful feeling of the weapons in Halo 1 and the way a lot of CCG cards seem to play off their "awesome factor". It's also part of the enjoyment of winning at games in general (the other part being pride), and even the enjoyment of
customization.
</p><p>
<b>Footnote on Engagement/Boredom</b>: This can be understood as the "fun of trying", whereas Empowerment is "the fun of winning".
</p><p>
<b>Footnote on Novelty Fun/Boredom</b>: This "feeling of progress" notion is the reason why game players seem to universally enjoy mechanics like having levels be locked until they've beaten the previous level, even though from a logical perspective it seems like this is strictly worse for the player.
</p><p>
<b>Footnote on Companionship/Loneliness</b>: This also explains why playing games with other people is almost universally much more fun than single-player.
</p><p>
<b>Footnote on Exhilaration/Restlessness</b>: This shows itself in a lot of ways, including getting to the climax of a good game or story, being on a large team and/or playing with stakes in a competition, and I think the enjoyment of spectating a prestigious tournament or similar is also a form.
It can also show itself in more meaningful ways, such as playing an important role in one's real-world cause (although most people have little to no experience with that, myself included).
</p><p>
<b>Footnote on Admiration/Disgust</b>: The concept of "ideals" is one that took me a long time to pin down. I think it's "what you'd will if you didn't have a personal stake in it". So by this token you can admire someone for being <i>closer</i> to your ideals than you, whereas back when I just called it "other wills in accord with self", I couldn't understand how that was
possible.
</p><p>
<b>Footnote on Validation/Embarrassment</b>: A lot of things about human behavior and psychology are explained by this.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
It's embarrassing to receive a compliment, condolescence or similar social idiom and not know how to respond. This is because we're worried that we'll be seen as rude or ungrateful. This is supported by my experience that the effect is less pronounced or gone entirely when the onlookers are people whose opinion you don't care much about, or who you know will
understand that you're just having trouble finding a tactful response.
</p></li><li><p>
It's embarrassing to be seen as acting one-sidedly hostile, such as being ungrateful for a significant favor, or physically or verbally attacking someone who isn't retaliating.
</p></li><li><p>
The general concepts of "dignity" or "formality" are often a form of this. For example, slouching while receiving grim news shows disrespect. The <a href="impurity">principle of purity</a> is behind this; such things have moral value through the feelings they project, affecting everyone present.
Everyone understands reverence on a <a href="conscience">conscientious</a> level and so it affects their emotions even if they consciously deny that it has moral value. Similarly, if a heated argument takes place while eating, ceasing to eat while making your point is dignified.
</p></li><li><p>
Of course, losing an argument or being the last one to solve a puzzle is often embarrassing, because it makes you appear less intelligent, and everyone wishes they were intelligent.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Footnote on Schadenfreude/Anger</b>: Sometimes, when you're having a really hard time with something (programming triggers me like this all the time), self-pity would be the "natural" response, but you might feel something you'd rather label as "frustration" instead. I believe this is actually the feeling I'm labeling "anger", and it
comes from implicitly personifying fortune as victimizing you. The reason for doing this is that it can be more comfortable due to the shifting of the blame off yourself and thereby elevating your self-opinion. It can even lead to some synthesized schadenfreude when you finally get it working (I experienced this a lot when I was younger).
One should avoid this though; it's worse for your productivity in my experience, and also you're likely to end up taking your anger out with other people and making their day worse as well.

<p>
A few notes about things that aren't on the list and what they're composed of:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
Gaming "salt" is self-pity turned into a more anger-like annoyance (through the means described above) + embarrassment, because we feel it when we feel we 'should' have won the match, but didn't because of something that we see as 'bullshit', so we try hard to convince everyone of the same so that it won't damage their opinion of our skill.
</p></li><li><p>
Gaming "tilt" (at least as I used to feel it) is frustration, combined with zero or more of a couple others: humbling (finding out I'm not as good as I thought), embarrassment (losing to a much weaker player), and losing rating is a trigger of both (since it's both how I measure my own skill and how other people measure my skill).
</p></li><li><p>
I think "grief" is actually mostly a form of self-pity (from how much worse your life will be without the person) and loneliness, coupled with some amount of sympathy.
</p></li><li><p>
I think the feeling of agitation from being around someone you don't like is actually just instinct - you associate negative emotions with being around those people, so just being around them can make you feel unhappy even if nothing's happening. Their presence is a reminder. Likewise the feeling that it's pleasant to be with someone
you like even if you're not interacting with them.
</p></li>
</ul>
<!--<p>Finally, I want to talk about a concept I noticed near the beginning of my philosophizing about this, but I didn't fully understand until after I made this website and all. It's the concept of choosing to switch between anger (or sometimes disgust) and other, more "tame" forms of sadness. Specifically, there are three situations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>-->
<!--
Refusing to feel disgust and/or anger at someone for being evil. Some people sometimes react to others doing deplorable things with what I would argue is loneliness (of not being able to share their values with the sinner) and/or self-pity from not being able to admire them (that would be pleasant), or just not feeling anything.
This is a morally perverse decision made in self-interest:
loneliness and self-pity can be less painful than anger sometimes because it doesn't urge you to try to enact retribution (which can be inconvenient, costly, or risky for oneself). Even if you're not in a position to immediately enact retribution, ideological anger tends to be a more obsessive emotion that won't let it go until
you've found a way to serve justice, or it may just take energy to express and you're lazy. It may also be because someone has convinced themselves that anger is wrong (or whatever bullshit), and so they have to do this to stick to their principles (choosing to preserve their what I've labeled above as "self-esteem" instead of their conscience).-->
<!--</p></li><li><p>
Anger at someone for something that isn't their fault or that they've sincerely repented for. This is an equally morally perverse decision made in self-interest. Anger can be less painful than the more appropriate emotions sometimes because it allows you
to look forward to the possibility of relieving your pain through enacting (undeserved) punishment. Anger might also have the effect of elevating one's self-opinion by comparison to someone you're telling yourself is worse.-->
<!--</p></li><li><p>-->
