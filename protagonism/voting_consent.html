TITLE "Representation" - The worst argument for the legitimacy of government?
NAV The "representation" argument
TEMPLATE DEFAULT

<p>
One of the most laughable arguments for the legitimacy of democratic government is,
"you aren't being forced because you get a say in making the laws".
<!--https://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/democracy-human-rights-and-governance/supporting-free-and-fair-elections
or any other result from "democracy is fair".-->
In what sense do I have a say if the outcome is the same regardless of what I say?
</p><p>
What if I say, "I'm going to generate 300 million random numbers 1 or 2 and let you pick the 301 million and
first. If more than half of the numbers are 2, I'll <a href="enforcement">take your money</a>, otherwise
I'll let you keep it. I'm giving you a say so I'm not violating your
<a href="/protagonism/property">right to your property</a>"?
</p>
Even those who voted for the winning candidate are being violated by having that politician's decisions
forced on them. Arguing that voting for a politician constitutes your consent to be governed by them is
like arguing that because you choose being punched over being stabbed, you somehow consent to
being punched.
