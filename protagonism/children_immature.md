NAV Children aren't as immature as you think
DESC Children are not as immature as they appear. They just have a different perspective, and we would do well to consider what it's like for them.

The perception's common that small children are extremely entitled. They cry whenever they don't get everything they want, even when it's not something they're entitled to! What selfish behavior! Or is it?

As adults, we have a biased perspective because we know about things they don't. We know about the world, we know about work and stuff. But children *don't know that those things exist*. They've never *seen* anything but play (well, and [abuse](children)). They have no way of knowing that we don't live in a post-scarcity utopia and that the scarcity they face isn't imposed by their parents. With their information, their play truly is the most important thing in the world by elimination. So why not cry about it?

The real maturity is to recognize when another person doesn't see what you see, and to judge them from their own perspective.
