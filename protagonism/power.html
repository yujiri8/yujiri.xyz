<p>
It's really disappointing that even some of my favorite other philosophers cling to the senseless idea that power corrupts you.
When I spell it out I can get most people to admit that being powerful doesn't in any way override our free will, so
just where is this idea coming from? The only thing we could mean by 'corrupt' in that sentence that doesn't contradict free will
is that having lots of power just raises the temptation. And this might seem to make sense when you consider that power
can mean you face less consequences for being corrupt... except, it still doesn't.
</p><p>
It's true that being powerful enables you to get away with corruption. But <i>this
<a href="/argument/noncomparative">works just as well in the opposite direction</a></i>. Being powerful enables
you to do more good, and to not be <a href="bystander">held back by fear when good is unpopular</a>.
Power is completely orthogonal to good and evil; power in the hands of good people is no less beneficial than
power in the hands of bad people is harmful.
</p><p>
It's also worth noticing the difference between power and unaccountability. Unaccountability is not just extreme power.
Power means the ability to do things; unaccountability means not facing consequences for what you do. It's possible
to have power without unaccountability: for example, someone who could launch a missile but will be shot if they
do has a lot of power but is accountable. They could use this power to blow up a tyrant's military base. In fact,
this leads me to another point:
</p><p>
Power when it's not coupled with unaccountability is actually not even close to balanced; it's by far a <i>good</i>
thing, due to how temptation works. Bad people are selfish; when they desire to hurt others, they usually won't still
do it if it would get them hurt too. A selfish person would not give their own life to bomb someone they hate. But a
heroic person might give their life to bomb a tyrant's army, for example. Good people, being set apart from bad people
by having a value other than their own happiness, are <i>more</i> willing to use power than bad ones when it's not
coupled with unaccountability. When it is coupled with unaccountability, the two are fully symmetric.
</p><p>
The idea that "Good people should avoid power because they know they can't trust themselves not to use it for evil"
is just depressing to hear people express. That's called despair! If "good" people don't allow themselves to have
great power, then they can never solve great problems.
<!--If you can't trust your own self to use power more for good than for evil, then trying to do anything is pretty fucking 
useless, isn't it? Hell, shouldn't you just kill yourself if that's the case? I'm being serious. That's the only place that line 
of thinking can lead.-->
<!--I think most people understand this on some level and wouldn't actually refuse great power if they were given the choice.-->

The same thing applies to knowledge. You should never pass an opportunity to learn something at zero cost and zero risk (time
costs count obviously but I feel that if I don't say so explicitly someone will take the opportunity to strawman me). Even
sensitive information, like someone else's password, you might as well ascertain if you can, because knowledge in the hands of a
good person is strictly beneficial to the forces of good. You never know what might come up. At worst, the information will
never be useful and they will never know that you "violated their privacy".
