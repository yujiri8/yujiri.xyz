TITLE The two righteous philosophies of "deserve"
NAV The two righteous philosophies of "deserve"
TEMPLATE DEFAULT

<p>
When people say what someone "deserves", there are two common senses in which they might mean it.
</p>
<p class="indent">
	<b>The judgement sense</b>: the ideology that good people deserve fortune and bad people deserve misfortune.
	What someone deserves is determined by how good of a person they are.
</p><p class="indent">
	<b>The ownership sense</b>: the ideology that people have <a href="property">the right to not interact
	with others</a>, and thus that if you define "deserve" to mean "it's righteous to make things this way", then
	people by definition deserve whatever they have unless they took it from someone else who deserved it.
	This definition of "deserve" isn't about <i>good</i> versus <i>bad</i> so much as it's about <i>rights</i>.
</p><p>
It's interesting to note that the philosophies of Judgement and Ownership here correspond to
<a href="anarchism_conversion">Chaos Anarchism</a> and <a href="anarchism">Anarcho-Capitalism</a>,
and that <i>both of them are right</i>.
</p><p>
Protagonism upholds both of these philosophies under the names of <a href="virtues">Rectitude and
Consent</a>. Of course everyone believes both to some degree, but for liberals, (and conservatives to a slightly
lesser extent,) the Ownership aspect is way too weak because they advocate things like gun restrictions and hate
speech laws (I hear Canada has them) and <a

for slavery</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6HEH23W_bM">progressive tax</a> while for
libertarians the Judgement aspect is too weak since they <span class="note">I'm talking about the consistent ones like
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh5fUEtDdwOAj59f6FvDGWw">Backalley Philosophy</a> and <a rel="nofollow"
href="https://zerothposition.com">Zeroth Position</a>, not the "Libertarian Party"</span> usually
advocate no exceptions to the sovereignty of private property rights whatsoever.
</p><p>
I believe both in such a way that private property is usually sovereign, but Judgement can trump it in a sufficiently
extreme case, such as a person who refuses to save an innocent life at a small cost to his property (obviously
you can steal it from him if you can't save the person yourself) or perhaps a business owner who uses his economic
power widely to reward bad behavior, censor people who tell truths he doesn't like, et cetera. (And obviously
<a href="consequentialism">strategy</a> can "trump" either of them in the short-term, but that's not really
trumping.)
</p><p>
The selling point of my moral system is that everything is negotiable.
My creed is robust in any situation while those of pure libertarians lead to unreasonable implications in
extreme situations. For example Filthy Heretic (one of the Backalley Philosophy members) put out a video on his own
channel where <a href="https://youtu.be/sswN6ZeA_JE?t=1015">he said that if you have a cure for cancer and could give
it to an entire planet of people at no cost to yourself, you're not obligated to do anything because Muh
Self-Ownership</a>. (To be fair to him he was actually arguing against
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Directive">the Star Trek prime directive</a> and just tacked on
the addendum that you aren't <i>required</i> to do anything.)
