DESC A materialist account of consciousness entails that free will is impossible that and that all of our moral values are illegitimate.

The conventional understanding of existence, where everything is made of matter and consciousness is a product of matter, is completely backward and could not be more wrong. I'm going to point out all the many plotholes in this understanding of the world and show that consciousness must exist independently from matter, not vice versa.

### Argument One: Free Will

The existence of free will is incompatible with a physical account of consciousness. In a physical system, every event is caused by the previous event, every chemical reaction by the previous reaction. While some modern scientists might argue that physical reality is actually probabilistic rather than deterministic, that doesn't help - randomness isn't any closer to free will than determinism.

But the whole idea of free will is that *nothing* causes it. It could have been different without any of its precendents being different, yet the person has control of it. There's an irreducible concept of "choice" here that cannot be a product of determined causation and randomness.

Some people try to tamper with the concept of personal identity to get around this. You might argue that "I" *am* my brain, and so whatever "decision" my brain makes is the "choice" "I" made with my "free" will. But then you'll notice you've redefined free will so that the definition is still met if external factors - the genes I was born with and my experiences - determine my actions. That's no different from a situation where a neurologist controls my brain; the causes are more distant but still deterministic. That's not fre will.

Therefore the only way to have free will is if your decisions are actually coming from some protected space outside of physical reality.

This is what I call a "soul", or more accurately, a person (since it is a person's behavior that defines "who" they are). A person can control their body through their brain, and can perceive the world through it, but the person themselves exists outside of their brain and is not controlled by it.

### Argument Two: Epistemics

The key realization here is that *we have never seen anything but consciousness*. Everything we believe in we only found out about through conscious experiences. We have not, and cannot, experience any facet of any physical object other than the perception of it. Therefore we have no basis for believing that they exist independently of conscious experience. And by "no basis", I don't just mean there's an unfulfilled burden of proof; I mean we *can't* believe in such a thing because we don't know what it *means* to exist without consciousness. The only definition of existence we have is perception. Believing that the physical world exists independent of consciousness is saying, "there is some kind of existence which can never be demonstrated and can never be understood." That's actually the least scientific thing I've ever heard.

### Argument Three: Intentionality

If your consciousness is a product of specific patterns of matter, then you *must* believe that those patterns of matter couldn't exist without being conscious (because if they could then there would be two physically identical systems with a mental difference and therefore minds couldn't be a product of physical reality). But is it possible to hold that position?

All of science is about studying how matter interacts. There's nothing else to study in science because that's all we can observe. And therefore it's impossible to say that there's something to matter besides how it interacts.

So materialism requires it to be *impossible* to have a system that behaves in a certain way without it being conscious. Materialism requires you to think that patterns of causal interactions between matter are what *define* consciousness, which is clear nonsense. 

### Argument Four: Universal Morality

If everything about our consciousness is a product of our brains, and our brains are a product of evolution, then our sense of morality is also just a product of evolution. And that means that by our own ideas of morality we can't hold our ideas of morality to be morally legitimate, because our source for them is just an arbitrary product of how our species evolved. There could be alien races that evolved to have a different idea of moral behavior and according to materialism, there's no way to argue that ours is better than theirs if they say murder is okay.

Therefore, conscience must be a facet of an immaterial soul, not of the brain.

And if you're going to try to argue morality is based on logic and doesn't need a conscience, then [you need to think that through more](conscience), but even besides that this same argument collapses the validity of our reasoning.

### Argument Five: Reliable Reasoning

You have to believe in the soul to believe that your own reasoning is valid. If your ability to reason is just a product of evolution, then there's no reason it would be accurate for determining truth in general. Natural selection would have given you a mind tuned for survival, and since philosophy has basically no bearing on survival, it wouldn't have given you the ability to understand metaphysics.

So materialism makes it at best a shaky, unprovable assumption that we even have the ability to reason reliably about metaphysics.

### So what's the truth?

The universe can be understood as an algorithm that allows souls to influence each others' experiences, but it cannot be understood as something that exists in its own right.

Objection: how do new souls get added? Clearly human procreation creates new souls if what I'm saying is true, and therefore physical things can have direct power over souls, right?

No; it gives souls a causal link with the universe that didn't have one before, which is only "creating a soul" insofar as you understand that existence is defined by consciousness and thus that "creating" a soul doesn't actually mean anything besides giving it its first experience. Souls having power over other souls' causal links with the universe is an extension of souls having casual links with the universe.
