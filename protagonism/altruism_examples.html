TITLE Why would Anarchy work? You're seeing it work right now.
NAV Examples of anarchic altruism
TEMPLATE DEFAULT

<p>
Many arguments against <a href="anarchism">anarchism</a> are based on the platitude that people are selfish
and that without a government to force them to behave ethically they'll inevitably exploit and victimize each other
to no end. Obviously the people who use this idea to justify said selfish people picking a group of them to be
granted the arbitrary authority to define what actions are acceptable are
most likely <a href="/argument/evasion">beyond reasoning with</a>, but as with many untrue ideas, there are
numerous ways to show how it's false, and the premise of this argument itself is one that I feel doesn't get enough
attention. I want to point out just a few of the outstanding examples of non-enforced human altruism that are so
powerful and undeniable that they are a major part of many of our lives.

<ul>
<li><p>
	Open-source software, most notably <a href="/computing/why_unix">Unix</a> and everything surrounding it.
	Thousands if not millions of people put enormous time and effort into making this software for anyone and
	everyone to benefit from and they're not making money from it.
</p></li><li><p>
	<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteer_fire_department">Volunteer Fire
	Departments</a>.
</p></li><li><p>
	Q&A sites like Stack Exchange and Quora, where thousands if not millions of people repeatedly answer other
	people's questions and help them solve their problems for no personal gain. Also mailing lists in the Unix
	community are a popular place for this type of beautiful interaction, though you won't know see that much
	if you're not involved in the Unix community.
</p></li><li><p>
	Wikipedia. How many people have devoted massive quantities of their time to giving other people information
	for free?
	</p><p>
	I've written at length about how <a href="wikipedia_bias">Wikipedia is a leftist propaganda
	platform</a>, but that doesn't change the fact that when they're not talking about politics or
	<a href="/argument/philosophy">philosophy</a> their information is usually good and it doesn't
	change the fact that the people who write that stuff are not usually getting personally rewarded.
<!--</p></li><li><p>
	Soldiers. Perhaps the strongest example: there are so many people willing to <i>risk their
	<b>lives</b></i> to do what they believe protects other people (albeit it's not actually helping in most
	cases but that's not the soldiers' fault) that the US government can get enough people to fight their
	wars without forcing anyone into service. And yes I know soldiers get paid but I don't think
	self-interest alone accounts for their actions, given how much easier it probably is to make a better
	living on a safer occupation working in the market.-->

If people do all these things as volunteers, just how stupid do you have to be to think that without the government
society would devolve into chaos and violence everywhere? It'd be the opposite since government is by the far the
largest committer of violent crimes per capita, including <a href="enforcement">armed extortion</a> and
<a href="imprisonment">kidnapping</a>. Most Anarchists argue for a society where crime-fighting and
protection services are provided on a <a href="market">free-market basis involving voluntary assocation</a>,
but even besides how obviously better that is, a quick glance at the real world makes it abundantly clear that there
would be people willing to do it for free for those who really couldn't afford it.
