TITLE The problem with the language of rights
NAV "Rights" language
TEMPLATE DEFAULT

<p>
It should be clear enough that "rights" are not a prime concept but a shorthand for the negative obligations of others. That is to say, "a person has a right to do X" really means "other people are wrong to prevent them from doing X".
And this shorthand is useful enough that I use it myself quite a bit. But it runs the risk of being misleading.

When you say "People have a right to not be physically harmed", this lends itself very easily to "People have a right to be protected from physical harm". Which is where <a href="anarchism">statists get the idea of creating a communal law enforcement fund and threatening everyone into funding it</a>
on the basis that "people have a right to protection, and so if you don't pay taxes you're depriving other people of their rights". The truth is "People have a duty to not physically harm each other", not "People have a duty to protect each other".

Another place this fallacy shows itself is in arguments for the minimum wage.
"It's immoral and exploitative to pay someone $4 an hour."
Oh yeah, what if I just don't employ them then? Your regulation isn't going to make me pay them more, it's just going to stop them from getting a job, and at that a job with a pay that they themselved judged to better than not having it before you interfered.
"All people have the right to work."
If you dispute this, then you're saying some people don't have the right to work therefore you're saying some people should be prevented from working (which is absurd of course even in the case of children). But if you accept the statement...
"If you don't employ this person, you're depriving them of work and therefore depriving them of their rights!"
