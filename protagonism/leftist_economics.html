TITLE An insight on the common error behind leftist economics
NAV Leftist economics
TEMPLATE DEFAULT

<p>
The central wrong idea underlying the economic policies of the mainstream American <a href="left_right">"left"</a> seems to
be this: everyone except me and the person I'm trying to help is a robot who has neither their own feelings and rights nor the
possibility of reacting to anything to I do in any way other than what I intend. Let me explain this.
</p>
<h4>Example #1: The minimum wage.</h4>
<div class="indent">
	<p>
	Equality is more important than fairness, so we should force employers (on the theory that they're wealthier than their
	employees which is isn't necessarily true itself especially when you count debt) to pay their employees more than the
	labor is worth to them.
	</p><p>
	Not only does this harm the employer, it probably won't result in the worker being paid more. If you're an employer and you
	want to hire someone for $6 an hour - and the potential employee thinks this is worth it for them - but the government
	won't let you employ them for less than $10 an hour, you're probably just going to not hire that person. So the result
	isn't low-skill workers being paid more but low-skill workers being unable to find jobs. <expand-note>
	And hence of course more justification for "the poor are downtrodden
	in this capitalist economy, we need the government to help them!"</expand-note>
	</p><p>
	I should also note that this concept seems inherently untenable because it can't be upheld consistently. What about a favor?
	Are you allowed to do someone a favor for $0 an hour? Or if there's some special case against 0, how about $3? What's the
	actual difference?
	</p>
</div>
<h4>Example #2: Anti-discrimination.</h4>
<div class="indent">
	<p>
	In a world with a completely <a href="market">free market economy</a>,
	being prejudiced would be a horrible business strategy. It deprives you
	of potential employees and customers and also vastly harms your reputation. But liberals saw a problem where it never
	existed and passed <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/epa.cfm">The Equal Pay Act</a>.
	<expand-note>(Notice what that means.
	Paying women less than men for the same work has literally been illegal in the US for 50 years. Keep that in
	mind when liberals claim women still face that systematically - it means either they're wrong or government
	intervention hasn't solved the problem.</expand-note>
	</p><p>
	You can't stop people from being prejudiced; but you <i>can</i> force them to hide their prejudice so the market doesn't
	punish them as described above, to be prejudiced in more subtle ways and lie and try to make up other excuses for why
	they're being asymmetric, which, if anyone is convinced <expand-note> (which certainly people are according to the
	leftist narrative)</expand-note>, will only improve the reputation of prejudiced people.
	</p><p>
	Additionally, discrimination being outright illegal actually discourages employers from hiring women because they
	know if they do they're at risk of being accused of paying them less and sued for it, and claims about such
	discrimination are often widely
	open to interpretation - note that the law uses language like "under similar working conditions". Who do you think's
	going to define what's <i>similar</i>?
	</p>
</div>
<h4>Example #3: Gun control.</h4>
<div class="indent">
	<p>
	This one is pretty obvious. <a href="rules">The only people who are using guns to commit crimes are the people who
	aren't going to follow your laws against gun ownership</a>; most of them probably either already have guns or can obtain
	them illegally and will be pleased to know their law-abiding victims won't be armed as well.
	</p><p>
	I read a wise sentence once: <i>If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.</i>
	</p><p>
	Also, and perhaps even more importantly, it's not like you can't mug or murder someone if you don't have a gun.
	Something like pepper spray is no less useful as a means of violence for most crimes. Even knives are pretty effective
	at exerting power over other humans.
	</p><p>
	Actually, you could make the argument - it says something that I've never once heard this articulated - that other
	weapons such as tasers are a sufficient alternative for defense and if done properly banning guns while making other
	weapons easier to obtain could make it less likely that a criminal could quickly kill a large number of people while
	still allowing defensive weapon use. This argument isn't entirely unreasonable when you discount the fact that gun
	control inherently involves <a href="enforcement">threatening to initiating violence against innocent people</a>,
	but at best this could stop new criminals from acquiring guns (it's impossible to confiscate the guns already sold to
	future criminals), and we should still consider that there's a cultural element of conservatives to own guns for reasons
	such as symbolic support for the Constitution, which doesn't carry over to tasers, so even still this would probably
	vastly decrease the likelihood of armed victims in cases of gun violence. You'd have a burden to prove that the net
	result is beneficial.
	</p><p>
	It's also important, of course, in any discussion of gun control to keep in mind the very important arguments that
	civilian gun ownership is an absolute necessity for defense against tyranny and also an enormous help against foreign
	invasion.
	</p>
</div>
<h4>Example #4: Communism.</h4>
<div class="indent">
	<p>
	Everyone will be equal! It's great!
	</p><p>
	Until people stop working because they're not personally receiving the benefits anymore. You can increase equality, but besides
	being theft it's going to drastically reduce the total wealth available because you've removed the self-interested incentive
	to work - you can just play all day and buy yourself food out of the communal wealth.
	It's necessarily false that this would work because if we had a sufficiently strong culture of altruism to make it work,
	<i>it by definition would already be happening</i> - people would be generous enough to just support the poor without
	being forced. You also wouldn't be arguing for a <a href="anarchism">statist model of law enforcement</a> because
	it would be <a href="altruism_examples">painfully obvious</a> that the poor would get protection more than amply
	from the charity of the rich.
