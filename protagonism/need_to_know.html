TITLE Need To Know Among Friends Is Bullshit

So this rant isn't strictly about Protagonism, but I'm putting it here because I don't know where else on my site to put it.
Need to Know is only legitimate when you don't fully trust the person in question. If you know
they're on your side, you should tell them everything, even if they don't have a specific "need" to know any of it. And it's not
just because of the <i>gesture of trust</i> aspect (although that alone is sufficient - it's the <a href="virtues">moral
value of Truth</a>). It is actually strategically advantageous to tell your whole force everything.
</p><p>
I know a lot of what I'm about to say won't apply to every situation Need to Know gets invoked in, but there are so many of them
- both real and fictional - that it was inevitable. I'll try to keep this as general as possible without making it useless.
</p><p>
First, let's get one thing straight: the commonly-raised argument in fiction that "what if one of us gets captured" is
<i>bullshit</i>. If they're going to be helping your cause, they already need to know at least who they're getting their orders
from, so having any member of your force get captured still leads to a chain reaction that threatens to undo your whole
organization.
</p><p>
For a positive
reason, how's this: you can't predict the future, so you don't know when an operative might need a given piece of information.
What if one of your operations goes south and someone winds up having to fill a role you didn't foresee? That is an extremely
general and plausible situation. Or what if one of your top-level people gets taken? If they were the only person who knew
certain pieces of information, that's all lost now. Not to mention the possibility that the rest of your members don't even find
out about it until it's too late.
</p><p>
You can definitely contrive a situation where need to know among friends is valid. But most of the ones I've seen or heard of
either in real life or in fiction don't qualify. I hope the next time you hear it invoked, you'll ask whether it's really wise
to keep secrets from goodguys in the given situation, and if you do I'm sure you'll realize that the answer is no.
