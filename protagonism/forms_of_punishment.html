TITLE Different Forms of Punishment And Their Pros And Cons
NAV Forms of Punishment
TEMPLATE DEFAULT

<p>
Many different forms of punishment have been invented and used throughout human history, but they're not all equally moral.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Imprisonment</b></dt><dd><p><a href="/protagonism/imprisonment">Never use</a>.</p></dd>
<dt><b>Pain</b></dt><dd><p>From a theorical perspective, this is an excellent method (for a reason discussed in the article on imprisonment). Another upside is that it's a feasible option in a lot of situations where these other methods aren't. Pain can be used in almost any situation where the criminal is someone
	you have non-digital social circle intersection with. The drawback is  that it's strictly negative-sum; it <i>only</i> punishes instead of extracting restitution. For that reason, it's generally preferable to use forced labor (see below) if possible.</p></dd>
<dt><b>Forced labor</b></dt><dd><p>
	Although forcing labor out of a criminal can require containing them, this method is kind of the opposite of
	imprisonment in two important ways. First, it forces the criminal to produce value that can be given to the victim as
	restitution or to the punisher to cover the costs of catching the criminal, rather than sitting in a cage all day doing
	nothing and eating food bought with taxpayer money. Also, and more importantly (yes I consider this more important) it
	reverses the moral backwardness of imprisonment, because instead of punishing the <a href="virtues">valuation of
	Freedom</a>, it rewards repentance by making diligent labor the path to quicker release.
	</p><p>
	The only downside of this method is the low practicality factor: forcing labor out of a criminal generally requires the
	punisher to be in a position of power similar to a government.
</p></dd>
<dt><b>Fines</b></dt><dd><p>This one is very similar to forced labor, and is a lot more practical. It's also the easiest one to do anonymously, avoiding any retaliation. So what's the downside? Well, depending on the criminal, collateral damage. If the criminal has a family, the rest of them will
	probably feel the impact just as much, or even entirely instead of the criminal (for example if the criminal is a child and their parents will just replace whatever you took from them). That's unacceptable. There's also the downside that it doesn't force diligence out of the criminal, so it
	doesn't have the same spiritual effect as forced labor.</p></dd>
<dt><b>Death</b></dt><dd><p>
	This one is unique in that it can't scale at all; it has a fixed magnitude. Death is mainly useful for pragmatic
	reasons; if the criminal(s) are an active threat, for example in the case of war (albeit that's a bad example because
	war isn't generally about punishment), death is often the only realistic option.
	<!--The real downside though is that we
	don't actually know what happens to people who die. We <a href="metaphysics">know they aren't their bodies</a>, so
	it's presumable that they continue to exist in some form. But what they experience after it is anybody's guess - maybe
	the afterlife is better than this life! We just can't know. That's why we should avoid using death as a punishment when
	possible.-->
</p></dd>
<dt><b>Ostracism</b></dt><dd><p>Not much of a punishment as it doesn't actively hurt the criminal, but this one has some upsides practicality-wise. It'll almost never be counter-punished, so it's well suited to situations where the criminal holds so much power that trying to really get back at them will just
	get you hurt as well and not succeed.</p></dd>
<dt><b>Exile</b></dt><dd><p>Exile is a lot like ostracism, except it has a lot of problems. It's like imprisonment in that it severely punishes anyone who was benefitting from the criminal being in their life (their family, employer, etc) but also it can't be done without controlling the borders of the area you're trying to exclude them from.
And even if you do have that, you've no way to exclude their friends and family from visiting them (since they have the right to leave your area of control without telling you why), so it probably isn't even very effective unless you have those people's cooperation.</p></dd>

<p>
One more thing I want to say. There's a particular case that comes up very often, which is a parent seeking to punish their child. There are a few common ways of doing this. One is a "time out", which, being a form of imprisonment, is absolutely not an option for conscientious parents. Another is "spanking", which, while I did say many positive words about using physical
pain, is also a non-option, because of the perverted nature of striking that particular body part. Ask yourself seriously and be honest: wouldn't that seem messed up if it was anyone other than a small child?
</p><p>
What to do instead? Obvious. The thing both children and parents seem to ignore is that each of the child's needs is at all times being provided for by the parent. What you should do as a parent is exploit that - don't feed them their next meal, or kick them out of the house for a while. This should make intuitive sense: if you want to punish someone who you're
currently helping, first stop helping them, then move into actual infringement. What most parents do is like a government punishing someone who receives welfare by inflicting pain but continuing to give them welfare. Would anyone argue that that makes sense?
</p><p>
Another thing to consider in the parent case is that most likely, the child genuinely doesn't realize that the food they eat and the house they live in aren't free to their parents. Children truly have no way of knowing this for their first several years. <expand-note><a href="children">And our culture makes a point to not give them any sense of duty or responsibility outside of school until they approach adult age.</a></expand-note> Even if they're too young to fully understand, using a form of punishment that involves demonstrating their dependence on your generosity instead of violating their rights is obviously a good idea.
