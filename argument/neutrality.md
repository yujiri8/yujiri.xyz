TITLE Stop worshipping neutrality
NAV Stop worshipping neutrality

A lot of people have neutrality as an ideal; they think it's wrong to be biased, at least in certain contexts, even if you know which side is right. This is [Wikiepedia's (claimed) policy](wikipedia_bias) of course. I've also heard conservative minarchists say that if they were a judge, they would be obligated to interpret the law as they thought it was meant *even if they thought that was unjust*.

The latter case is just [the psychology of statism](democracy_nihilism); the former is more defensible because at least it isn't *obviously* extremely harmful, but it still is harmful in the .

I don't know. Maybe wikipedia's policy makes sense.
