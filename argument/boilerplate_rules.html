<p>
In every online discussion forum or social media you go to, there will be a set of rules about "basic civility". This is expected
(<a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=19709">Although it's still a poorly thought-out practice</a>, and in fact
the fallacy involved is very similar to the main one <a href="/protagonism/leftist_economics#example-3-gun-control">behind gun
control)</a>. But on that list will almost certainly be several entries that are copy-pasted almost exactly between every
such medium on the internet. Naturally, the most ubiquitous are the least reasonable.

<li><p>
<b>"Hate speech".</b> My problem with this one is mostly just that the statement of the rule always includes stuff like
religion and <a href="/protagonism/gender">"gender identity"</a>. Those two don't belong in the same bag as gender,
race, age, and nationality, because <a href="/protagonism/discrimination">the latter are superficial traits, while
the former are traits we choose</a>. I also don't think it should be automatic to censor racism/sexism etc, but whatever.
Nobody I respect engages in those anyway.<!-- (and I've never seen the rules used to censor things that didn't actually fit,
unlike the sexual orientation rule).-->
</p></li>
<li><p>
<b>"Threats of violence".</b> I'm not saying moderators should never remove posts for being etremely inflammatory, but I do oppose a stated rule against posting threats. Stopping people from making threats doesn't stop them from wanting or trying to harm someone in real life, it only disables your warning mechanism.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<b>"Illegal stuff".</b> I don't know if they're legally required to put this, but it's absurd even beyond <a
href="/protagonism/anarchism">statism</a> itself because it implies that posting illegal stuff is wrong for a reason
besides it being illegal (because the government already forbids and punishes those actions, so making it a forum rule is
double-counting) - but also that it's the illegality that makes it wrong. It's self-contradicting. Though I guess statists
aren't known for having a problem with that...
