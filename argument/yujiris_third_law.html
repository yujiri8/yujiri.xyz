DESC The chance of a piece of writing being intelligent is inversely proportional to the proportion of words ending in -ism.

**Yujiri's Third Law: The chance of a piece of writing being intelligent is inversely proportional to the proportion of words ending in -ism.**

Capitalism, socialism, nationalism, liberalism, leftism, fascism, [individualism](individualism), collectivism, globalism, <!--colonialism?,--> modernism, progressivism, traditionalism, and leftism. If I could delete all occurrences of all these words from all writing and everyone's memory, I would do it.

A few that are quite a bit less harmful are libertarianism, conservatism, and anarchism. These words are much closer to having a consensus on their meaning. But still many libertarians disavow the Libertarian Party as not really libertarian and some libertarians claim you have to be a self-ownership absolutist to be a libertarian; anarchism has several factions that insist the other is not remotely anarchist; conservatism has at least a few agreed-on tenets.

I don't include communism because I think there are actually few disagreements about its meaning; socialism, though, is often used as if it means something very different (many more will identify as socialists or 'democratic socialists' than as communists).

I don't include authoritarianism because it's fairly close to having a solid meaning: the use of a position (which is always said to be about the *position* or the *office* rather than the person who has it) to discourage someone with lesser authority from acting on their own conscience.

I thought of this reading Rechelon's [The Continuing Obfuscation of Nationalism](http://humaniterations.net/2018/10/18/the-continuing-obfuscation-of-nationalism), which mentions a few more I've rarely seen, including 'expansionism' and 'segregationism'.

I use a lot of these words myself. I try to use them in contexts that give them a clear meaning, but there are probably places I use them wrongly. Point them out if you find them.
