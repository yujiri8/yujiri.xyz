DESC It's trivial to fake anyone saying anything in any context on the internet. Screenshots prove nothing.

I lurk and comment in a lot of online political circles, so I have a fair amount of experience with the
shadow wars of lies and character assassinations that go on in those circles. I'm going to point out a simple
and obviously provable fact that if people would realize would do a lot of good for the world:
<b>having a screenshot of someone saying something on the internet proves NOTHING.</b>

Look, I'm not normally the kind of person who would use caps like that, but this just makes me so mad,
especially since it's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HY-_gi2lBY">been</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pP8jVr2CY0">used</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IJMNtv-YfA">to</a>
character-assassinate some people I admire and that do a lot of good like Esoteric Entity.

I wouldn't even need to be proficient to be an image editor.
Browsers have something called devtools. I can use them to fake anyone saying anything in any context
in 5 minutes. You could also learn how to do it in a couple of hours even if you know next to nothing about
computers. People who want you to believe something are willing to lie, and if it's easy to do that
then they'll fucking lie. Especially when the lie is an accusation of someone else lying, for god's
sake people stop turning into fucking mindless drones every time you see a goddamn image.

For all I know Eso and friends very well could've faked all their images. Faking video would be a lot harder
from what I know but I don't doubt it can be done with a little knowledge.
It does make me suspicious that Eso acts like there's no significant possibility from our perspective
that he's lying, but the other side's "evidence" is ALL a joke and the fact that they
can't do anything but character assassinations corroborates this. Even besides that the fact
that Eso and friends are <a href="/protagonism/anarchism">anarchists</a> makes them significantly
more trustworthy than other people just by itself, because it shows that they are, at least in one way,
more loyal to reason than to the cult of violence they were raised to believe in.

Honestly, you see this same shit pulled against flat Earthers. I've seen people be like "Here's this image of the
Earth I found on Google Images eat shit you retard". Irrationality is frustrating enough but the most
frustrating thing is when the irrational people flame you for not being irrational in the same ways as them
using those very ideographs. And no I'm not a flat Earther.
