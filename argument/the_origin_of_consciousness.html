TITLE Rebuttal to Kurzgesagt's "The Origin of Consciousness"
NAV Rebuttal: The Origin of Consciousness
TEMPLATE DEFAULT
DESC As usual, materialists think they don't know what consciousness is, and thereby make themselves right.

<p>
I was linked to a Youtube video by a friend (my friend was not speaking positively of the video; it was just relevant)
titled <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6u0VBqNBQ8">"The Origin of Consciousness - How Unaware
Things Became Aware"</a> by "Kurzgesagt - In a Nutshell". As you can tell from the title, the "information" is
materialist and <a href="/protagonism/metaphysics">therefore subject to numerous intrinsic contradictions</a>.
This video goes above and beyond what I've heard from materialists before; I laughed so much at the insane nonsense
that I started writing a rebuttal, and enjoyed it so much that I ended up finishing it in the same night, which is
to say at 3 AM. I would've liked to deliver my rebuttal as a pausefest video, but unfortunately I still lack a decent
video recording setup, and have a few other obstacles to doing that, so I'll just post it here.

<blockquote>
Stripped to its core meaning, consciousness is what allows us to be aware both of our surroundings,
and of our own inner state.
</blockquote>
<p>
It doesn't bode well that he's making such a sloppy statement so early on. Consciousness <i>is</i> the being aware,
not something that <i>allows</i> us to be aware. This kind of language is usually a sign of people who don't
understand their own ideas...
</p><p>
I think we can just tune out his filler phrase "Stripped to its core meaning", which adds nothing to his statement
and serves only as a psychological trick to give the impression that what he's saying is more profound than it is.
There's going to be a lot more of this empty fake mysticism in this video.

But once we try to pinpoint just what exactly it is, it leaves us grasping at thin air.

<p>
Oh come on, that's because it's a prime concept! It can't be defined in terms of other things! That's like saying
it's some kind of profound mystery just what "quantity" is. You'll never find an answer to a null question,
and one of the trademarks of poor thinkers is that they can't tell the difference between a question they can't
answer because it's deep and one they can't answer because there's nothing being asked.

<b>Bullshit!</b> People who don't approach it like philosophy haven't figured it out, but I'm already
at a place you'll never be - figured out that there's no question.
One of the best ways to make it seem like you can't be refuted is to present it as fact that the question is unsolved
and that if you don't understand it, it's not even possible that someone else does.

<blockquote>
Like much of what makes us human, our consciousness is likely to have evolved from less complex forms as a
product of evolution by natural selection.
</blockquote>
<p>
He's going to outright mention <i>natural selection</i> in his attempt to delegitimize metaphysics. He just
committed suicide. Natural selection, the process that preserves only advantageous mutations, would have no
possible incentive to produce consciousness instead of an unconscious being that otherwise functions like
just a human. Surely it's just extra genetic baggage.

Materialists who realize this often end up going into <a rel="nofollow"
href="http://people.tamu.edu/~sdaniel/Notes/dualism.html">absurdly incoherent ideas like that consciousness
<i>is</i> behavior (or even literally that consciousness doesn't exist!)</a>
</p><p>
And naturally he doesn't think for a second about what the implications of this would do to his moral system.
If consciousness can evolve from non-consciousness, then couldn't there be something at any point between the two?
According to this claim, it's impossible to draw a hard divide between unconscious and conscious. If we believe this,
how will we resolve questions about the rights of beings inbetween us and rocks?
Most people already irrationally believe animals are a form of this, but if you outright say you believe consciousness
is a gradient, then there could be beings between <i>that</i> and us. It's <i>logically impossible</i> now to argue
that there can't be a species with <i>some</i> human rights but distinctly less. He <i>has</i> to believe that there
could be a species for whom <i>ideal moral behavior</i> from us could be treating them similarly to slaves.
I don't think this guy would be comfortable with that implication...

<blockquote>
What was the first step on this path from the non-conscious, to the basic consciousness that ultimately led to
the convoluted consciousness we humans enjoy today?
</blockquote>
<p>
Sad! Materialists can get away with just thoroughly explaining how broken their own ideology is and the reaction
they get is not "Wow that's a really big problem with your ideology" but "Wow what an interesting question!"
It is impossible for him to ever describe the first step because not only does such a thing not exist, not
only does thinking about it make it painfully clear that there's a hard line between non-consciousness and
"basic consciousness", but as I've explained before, it is impossible to have evidence for the existence of
consciousness without free will.

<blockquote>
A more common starting point is with a living thing.

<p>
I love how he just skips over the progression from non-conscious to barely conscious, because he couldn't
even whip up some bullshit to make it sound remotely coherent!

<blockquote>
A living thing, or a self, is a part of the universe that sustains itself, and makes more of its kind.

<p>
Hoho! He <i>actually played</i> the life definition! A materialist tried to define life, and to nobody's
surprise, his definition is too insane to believe it was anything other than the product of desperate
attempts to move mountains to save a broken metaphysics!
</p><p>
First of all, he includes the criterion "sustains itself" as part of the definition of life. I'm used to
dealing with non-definitions, but <i>phew...</i> What does "sustaining" mean? Does it mean keeping itself
alive? How long does something have to do that for to be considered "a living thing"? And how do you define
whether a being is sustaining itself or being sus-
</p><p>
wait. I just realized what's going on here. He included this because he's pro-abortion. He wanted to pick
out some arbitrary non-definable characteristic that most humans have but fetuses don't, and claim it's part
of the definition of life. Let's ask him whether he thinks newborns and disabled elders sustain themselves,
or if those people aren't living things and if not what he thinks of the morality of killing them.
</p><p>
Alright then, back to the <i>other</i> gaping flaw<i>s</i> in his definition...
</p><p>
If living things are material
objects reducible to their bodies and brains, how can you even delimit which pieces of matter are part of the
being or not? I assume he thinks my toe is part of me as an organism, even though I could survive without it,
but what about a microscoping piece of my toenail that I wouldn't notice, or a single molecule? What about a
dead skin cell I scratched off? Is it still part of me? What about the bacteria on my stomach?
All of these questions are unanswerable.
</p><p>
How dumb can you get? Let me unpause the video... oh, I forgot, that was only his first criterion!
He included <i>another</i> nonsensical criterion as part of the definition of life!
"makes more of its kind." <i>Oh</i> boy.
</p><p>
So anything that doesn't make more of its kind is not alive. If a god similar to the Christian conception
existed, he would not be alive. If there were a group of conscious and intelligent and social aliens on another
planet with no ability to reproduce, they wouldn't be alive. Actually... wasn't there an episode of Star Trek
about that? Or if he prefers a more "realistic" example, suppose human sterilized themselves so none of them could
reproduce anymore; do we lose our status as living beings? Or what if the eventual end of natural selection
produces life forms that don't need to reproduce because they can live forever (sustaining themselves!)?
</p><p>
Additionally, does this criterion have to apply to each organism we consider a living thing, in which case no
one who dies before having kids was ever alive? <span class="note">And does having had kids in the past make you count
as alive for the rest of your existence? If so, why didn't he use the present perfect tense?</span>
Or does a species only have to have this ability for each member of it to be considered alive? In that case,
you run into issues demarcating whether an organism is a member of a given species! Are people with rare genetic
mutations human? What if humans and aliens could interbreed, what species would the children be? What if the aliens
could reproduce sexually with humans, but not with themselves (they live forever)? Does that count? If so, what
if humans built a machine that could take rocks and use them to produce another rock? Do all rocks suddenly become alive?
His entire worldview is ludicrous!
</p><p>
I know a three-year-old who understands what constitutes life better
than this guy. By the way, the definition of life is a two-way causal link between a soul and a universe.

To do so, it needs energy. And <i>this</i> is where an awareness of the world comes in handy.

<p>
No, you absurd liar, it's where <i>behaving</i> comes in handy. Nothing about having perception organs and a brain
that controls the muscles based on them necessitates having the type of "mystifying" experience you described in
the beginning. Or are you going to become a behaviorist materialist like I mentioned above and claim it does?

(He describes in detail exactly how a physical organism can "behave" so as to sustain itself and give the outward
appearance of intelligence without making any reference whatsoever to consciousness. Then more or less admits it,
and claims that "the next step on the ladder of consciousness is to add some perception at a distance.")

<p>
Ha! Imagine that! Perception at a distance is a "step on the ladder of consciousness"! Are blind people
unconscious? What a politically incorrect thing to say...

(He describes more how vision enables us to get a <i>sense</i> of the space around us, and how this is a huge

<blockquote>
To visualize food in its absence, for example, a self needs to create some sort of inner representation of the
world. Now, an animal can continue looking for food, even when it escapes its sensory range. Because of this
inner representation of what is relevant in the world, it can remain focused on its food and its desire to get it.
Our self now exists in a world it can get familiar with. The ability to remember things has emerged.
</blockquote>
<p>
There he goes. He's a behaviorist materialist. He actually thinks being able to store a "representation" of the world
and act on it constitutes memory in the conscious sense. Does he think my laptop can remember things via its
filesystem cache? Is he really unable to tell the difference between that and conscious memory? What am I saying,
of course he is.

<blockquote>
Human babies tend to develop this ability around the time they turn 8 months.
</blockquote>
<p>
This is an absurdly high guess even if you don't count recognizing their parents as object permanence, which I'm
not sure why you wouldn't. Our experience with <a href="/protagonism/soul_anatomy">the soul's instinct</a>
indicates that any being with such an instinct
learns this incredibly obvious concept after the first few hours of experience with it. The only thing I can think
of that would impede it from happening on day 1 with non-people objects is newborns not having clear vision,
which I've heard they don't, so I won't argue it happens on day 1, but I know from experience with four
toddlers in my life that it happens a long time before 8 months.
</p><p>
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/parenting/object-permanence#age">According to even some
other materialists, his info is outdated and it happens at 2-3 months</a> (although they go on to say 4-7 months,
after describing the concept without using its name and saying 2-3).

(He finally mentions that memory suggests a sense of time.)
A sense of time, is a big step on the ladder of consciousness. It may also enable oneself to look forward
from the present moment and anticipate the future.

<p>
Yes, a sense of time is a major corollary of consciousness. I've still heard nothing about how or why
natural selection created consciousness from unconsciousness.

This sort of delayed gratification means there is an ability to visualize a reward that only exists in the future.
Which can be quite a challenge even for adult humans. (The video shows an animation of a human picking a single
slice of pizza over a full pizza with a clock over it.)
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>
	It doesn't require visualization, as demonstrated by people born blind. FUCKING THINK.
</p></li><li><p>
	No, it's not a challenge for adult humans. Humans just have time preference. It's not that we can't
	visualize the future reward or don't understand that it would be bigger, we just prefer to have it now.
	There could be some interesting discussion about that phenomenon, but I know we're not going to get

<blockquote>
Words enable us to think about ourselves and our place in the universe. And even, about our own consciousness.
</blockquote>
<p>
So he also thinks we can't think about those things without words. You actually can even after being raised
to speak a language; if you pay close attention you'll notice that the actual thought is wordless; feelings
can be experienced and logical deductions can be made without imagining words. Probably the only purpose the
words serve is to make it easier to remember your train of thought, by attaching perceptions which seem to me to be
more easily linked by instinct. Of course, it doesn't surprise me one bit that that guy is nowhere near intellectual
enough to think of actually <i>trying</i> such a thing. It's not like testing is the basis of science, is it?

<blockquote>
It probably all started with the urge for more food. So even with this sophisticated consciousness that allows
us to dream about space, build skyscrapers, or obsess about novels, it's not surprising that we can't stop thinking
about where we'll get our next meal.
</blockquote>
<p>
Yet another sparkling demonstration of the mental illness of materialism. To this guy, the conscious experience
of the pain of hunger and the experience-trained belief that eating relieves the feeling manifesting in a temptation
to eat isn't a sufficient explanation for why humans like to eat. He needs to invent this absurd history to explain
what was not unclear, to answer a question that doesn't exist. This is actually quite revealing;
no wonder he couldn't understand consciousness in the beginning - he's been trained to see consciousness not as
the <i>cause</i> of behavior, not even as an epiphenomenon, but merely a metaphor for behavior. It's the purest self-destroying ideology, and
it destroys as well everything its believer believes
or values, by delegitimizing all facets of his mind as arbitrary and meaningless.

At the end of the video, he mentions how it was funded by a grant from the Templeton World Charity Foundation.
Figures. Materialists don't have any substance to argue with so they need donations to hire artists and animators
for a video backdrop to distract you from how nonsensical their "information" is. Now I know never to donate to the
Templeton World Charity Foundation, because they fund propaganda videos that are ruining people's ability to think.
