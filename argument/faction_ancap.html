DESC An exploration of Ancap ideology, strawmen against it, valid criticisms of it, and the psychology behind it.

Here I'll explore anarcho-capitalism, debunk strawmen of it, offer legitimate criticisms of it, and offer some insight on what leads people to it. I'm making this article in the interests of increasing understanding between the different part-good factions and hopefully building some bridges.

My background with the ideology is that Ancaps pretty much converted me away from [Chaos Anarchism](/misc/anarchism_conversion) and convinced me to identify as an Ancap for some time (I'm hesitant to call myself that now). I've spent a *lot* of time in their circles, debated with them, memed with them, and consider them essential allies and mostly friends.

# The ideology

First, definitions.

**Anarchism** - this is my own dictionary - [is the belief that no group of people can legitimately change the law](/protagonism/democracy_nihilism). In Ancaps' own dictionaries, anarchism is generally seen as synonymous with capitalism (for reasons I'll explore later).

**Capitalism** - in the Ancap dictionary - means property rights and freedom of association, and any government interference with [the market](/protagonism/market) is anti-capitalist. This contrasts with the dictionary of their opponents: most who say they oppose capitalism use the word to describe government actions and interventions on behalf of corporations that give them <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incorporate.asp">gives business owners legal privileges that contradict market principles</a>. By the Ancap definition of capitalism, these things are *anti-*capitalist and unethical. Don't use this to strawman anarcho-capitalism.

There are additional differences in how property rights work between mainstream Ancap thought and statist thought: **anarcho-capitalists almost always reject intellectual property altogether, while supporting land tenure.** I'll explore the inconsistency here below.

In Protagonist terms, the ideology is a near-supreme valuation of consent, plus a somewhat flawed conception of what consent is and applies to.

When I talk about Anarcho-capitalism in a vacuum, I'm usually talking about only the combination of anarchism and capitalism, but for this article I'm talking more about the movement than just what the principles themselves entail.

Ancaps describe themselves as libertarians, but adamantly distinguish themselves from the "Libertarian Party", which they often describe as not really libertarian for believing in "minimal" government. They also use the label "voluntarist" or "voluntaryist" (which I think is much better for them PR-wise).

Almost all Ancaps are [deontologists](/protagonism/consequentialism). David Friedman is a notale consequentialist Ancap, but deontologism is dominant enough that you can safely assume it.

Many Ancaps (but far from all) consider themselves right-wing and most hate communism as much as statism. The "right" referred to here is other values and cultural norms [considered right-wing](/protagonism/left_right), minus a few that are obviously anti-anarchist like the conservative infatuation with police.

# Strawmen

* Ancaps are not pacifists. They recognize the legitimacy of violence in defense or retaliation against aggressors; they use the word **aggression** to mean *initiatory* force and are adamant about the distinction; and they usually also recognize a clear threat of aggression as ground to retialite. You can definitely find a few that are pacifists, but it's like arguing that Islam is a terrorist religion because ISIS <span class="note">unrelated to this discussion, there might be valid ground to make the case that Islam is a terrorist religion, but just the example of ISIS doesn't prove it</span>. This strawman is mostly used by conservatives and minarchists.

* Ancaps don't have a problem with modes of organization other than traditional capitalist business models, as long as no one's forced to participate (though their definition of *forced* is often questioned; see below). There is nothing about an opt-in commune or worker co-op that's incompatible with Ancap ethics.

# Derivation and absolutism

Ancaps almost always refer to [self-ownership](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GazZBvHhgQ) and [the homestead principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestead_principle) as the basis of their ideology. Many if not most of them rely on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://mises.org/library/argumentation-ethics-and-liberty-concise-guide">argumentation ethics</a> as their basis for their ethics. I've ripped it to shreds [here](/protagonism/conscience) and in a couple of other places, but I've very rarely got a response from an Ancap.

The worst problem with the Ancap movement is their absolutism. Many or most of them claim it's never moral to violate property rights for any reason. You can raise "one person to save the world" and they're prepared to stand by no. You can raise "steal to survive" and most will say that *they* would be disgusted with that person for not helping and refuse to associate with them, but that using force is still completely unethical (curiously, the only one I've heard tried to come up with an exception for this was Nullus Maximus with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.zerothposition.com/2016/03/07/the-reecean-proviso/">the Reecean Proviso</a>, but I doubt anyone needs me to point out all the glaring problems with his reasoning).

# Real anarchists?

Ancaps and Ancoms are always fighting about who's the "real anarchists". Both insist the other is inherently authoritarian and effectively statist. It's really sad to see. What I've noticed from debating with them is the way they define statism:

* Because Ancaps think aggression is always wrong and that anything non-aggressive is okay, they actually *define statism to be aggression*. I don't know how many of them realize it, but they do. You'll [hear them say](https://youtu.be/On6ml8sb0AM?t=105) things "if there's anything, even one case, where you want to initiate force against an innocent party, you *are* a statist, because by definition, you're calling for a state to be formed, because the state *is* the means by which you get the perceived legitimacy to initiate force".

* Meanwhile, Ancoms seemingly define statism to be hierarchy.

I define statism to be [the idea that some group of people can legitimately change the law](/protagonism/democracy_nihilism). So I consider both of them valid anarchists.

# The inconsistency with property mechanics

Ancaps say intellectual property is invalid because ideas are not scarce and so can't be owned. But here's the thing: *neither is land use*. While land itself is *physically* scarce, the relevant corollary of scarcity isn't present because [someone can generally "trespass" on your land without depriving you of it](/protagonism/property#trespassing-isn-t-the-crime-you-think-it-is). If you really believe that it can't violate property rights to benefit from someone's labor without their consent because it doesn't deprive them of it, doesn't that collapse absentee ownership altogether? As long as I can use it without depriving you of it, it's effectively non-scarce, so why can't I trespass, or (insert euphoric Marxist) use your factory equipment without your consent?

I've yet to get a satisfactory answer to this from an Ancap.

I have another disagreement with them on property rights, namely [sharing nature](/protagonism/property#sharing-nature), but that's not an inconsistency on their part.

# The psychology

One of the core appeals of NAP purism is its simplicity. It promises to answer basically all questions about ethics with a single, sweeping answer.

In one reddit argument, a proponent raised the point that "The reason morals are necessary is to resolve conflicts". For a moment there, I thought that was insightful. That day I first saw the lure of argumentation ethics. It makes sense. It's elegant. It would be so satisfying to believe that.

But on closer inspection, that destroys the whole point. As soon as you say the words "the reason morals are necessary ...", you imply that morals are something we make up to achieve some amoral goal, which destroys the whole concept of morals. If morals themselves are a means to an end, then *there are no morals*.

# The danger of logic

Ancaps are a sparkling example of what might be a way deeper insight I'm starting to have: **logic is dangerous**. A misguided loyalty to "logic" can lead you to some very dark places ideologically.

Ancaps have their "logic" showing that aggression is never okay period, and they'll follow this anywhere. Since the logic is so clear and vindictive to them, it starts to replace their conscience as a moral compass. And the bigger the disparity gets, the more I suspect they decide that their "conscience" is just biased emotions and not even a reliabale moral compass. Almost no Ancap makes any reference to conscience anywhere. They don't believe in it anymore. To them, adherence to self-ownership has become the definition of good.

So naturally they lose any sympathy they might've had for "what if I have to use aggression to survive" arguments. With no caveats, homesteading and property ethics become shockingly close to a might-makes-right philosophy: you're entitled to whatever you can acquire, basically, and nothing else, with only the one caveat that you can't use initiatory force.

Nullus Maximus is the best example here. He regularly talks about how "every man is entitled to whatever he can capture and hold, nothing more and nothing less". Actually, holy hell, in <a rel="nofollow" href="http://disq.us/p/192hdqz">this comment replying to an Ancom</a>, he literally says "If people are too incompetent to homestead anything and die as a result, then good riddance. Natural selection eliminates the unfit.". He *realizes* how his ethics are essentially might-makes-right. And he likes it. That's the really horrifying thing. When you let "logic" distort your mind for long enough, you can come to positively like what it does to you.

Another terrible consequence you can see on them is how this absolutist loyalty to self-ownership drives them away from being able to make any moral judgements of peaceful actions. The better Ancaps realize that it's legitimate for them to think an action is bad even if it's peaceful (and thus 'ethical'), but others <a rel="nofollow" href="https://youtu.be/AspFfALQSsU?t=119">seem to really want to hide from that concept</a>.

# So what the hell's with the "alt-right"?

TLDR: it's mostly the twin powers of [reactance](https://yourbias.is/reactance) and [groupthink](https://yourbias.is/groupthink).

I hate talking about the "alt-right" as it legitimizes the term that's so often weaponized as a smear against libertarians, but I can't deny anymore that there's something real it refers to. When I talk about the alt-right I'm talking about a loose faction defined by:

* Support for [borders](/protagonism/borders) (and usually [quarantines](/protagonism/quarantine))

* Legitimate bigotry of the sort liberals are always crying wolf about: misogyny and white supremacism. Usually alt-righters will talk about how minorities are more violent and less intelligent ([statistics](statistics) on [IQ](iq) <a rel="nofollow" href="https://stonetoss.com/comic/state-of-mind/">are a favorite</a>) and draw completely insane conclusions about how this somehow isn't explained by cultural and economic factors and indicates some sort of inherent inferiority. (The comments on that Stonetoss comic are saying that blacks have smaller brains than whites.)

* A deeply concerning loss of ideological compassion: alt-righters are drenched in [the enforcement fallacy](/protagonism/enforcement), blind to [moral conflict](/protagonism/moral_conflict), and they love the pseudo-might-makes-right philosophy Nullus Maximus espoused above (and don't think or care about the possibility that someone could fail to homestead anything due to being unlucky instead of "incompetent"). Alt-righters harbor little sympathy for the victims of state violence even where they recognize how completely unjust it is.

I'd say alt-right sympathies are an infection Ancaps contract from culture battling liberals. It happens because when you mostly deal with people who want to use the state to enforce their ideas of social justice and equality, and you know the state is evil, it's easy to start to feel that social justice and equality are the problem too, that they're somehow inherently linked with statism. When you hate someone so much, you want to disagree with them on everything you can. *They can't just be wrong about enforcement. They have to be wrong about their goals too. They have to be wrong about everything.*

And of course once an Ancap starts to develop alt-right sympathies, they see those farther fallen from grace in a more positive light and let their guard down around them. Those who fall an inch are dragged down much farther by those already more steeped in it.

Stonetoss is one of the more developed alt-right transformees, I think. His scariest comic is <a rel="nofollow" href="https://stonetoss.com/comic/use-it-or-lose-it/">this one seemingly arguing that libertarians have to use the state to crush leftists out of self-defense</a>. I can genuinely see how a former libertarian would get to that now. Fucking hell, I think it's possible.

Whenever an Ancap mentions Antifa, rest assured they'll portray Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization with no redeeming traits and give very weak or no sources for it. This happens even without any alt-right transformation (I've seen Filthy Heretic talk about them), but it gets more intense; Nullus Maximus published [an article basically giving the state advice on crushing Antifa](https://www.zerothposition.com/2017/05/10/strategy-against-antifa-2nd-edition/). Honestly, "13-15" in that article is making me seriously wonder whether it's legitimate to call him a fascist.
