TITLE What If Everyone Thought That Way Is One Big Fallacy
NAV What If Everyone
TEMPLATE DEFAULT

<p>
A common argument raised against many good ideas is some variation of "if <i>everyone</i> thought that way, X would happen".
For example, when I was young and indoctrinated with <a href="/protagonism/left_right">conservatism</a>,
I was taught to think, "it might not seem like my vote makes a difference, but if no one voted, the system would
fall apart, therefore I should vote". This is totally fallacious reasoning.
</p><p>
My decision is causally independent of everyone else's. It will not affect anyone else's decision,
so if it really is true that my vote is not an efficient way for me to create change, then I shouldn't vote, no matter what
would happen if no one voted.

Dear Wikipedia admins, look I understand (from making RTTP) the frustration of being a volunteer and not getting paid,
but you are <i>lying</i>. $2.75 will make no discernible difference. Change it to say "if
<i>a whole bunch</i> of people donated just $2.75, Wikipedia could keep thriving".
