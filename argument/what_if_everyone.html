DEC "What if everyone..." is just a non-sequitur. My decision is causally independent of everyone else's.
MARKDOWN

A common argument raised against many good ideas is some variation of "if *everyone* thought that way, X would happen". For example, when I was young and indoctrinated with [conservatism](/protagonism/left_right), I was taught to think, "it might not seem like my vote makes a difference, but if no one voted, the system would fall apart, therefore I should vote". This is just a blatant non-sequitur.

My decision is causally independent of everyone else's. Whether I vote doesn't affect whether everyone else does, so if it really is true that my vote is not an efficient way for me to create change, then I shouldn't vote, no matter what would happen if no one voted.

Dear Wikipedia admins, look I understand (from making RTTP) the frustration of being a volunteer and not getting paid, but that's blatantly false. $2.75 will make no discernible difference. A truthful version this would say "if *a whole bunch* of people donated just $2.75, Wikipedia could keep thriving".
