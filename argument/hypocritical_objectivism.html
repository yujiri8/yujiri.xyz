DESC "The thing I value must be the only objectively valuable thing because all other values are subjective."

Hypocritical objectivism is a term I'm coining for arguments to the effect of "the thing I value must be the only objectively valuable thing because all other values are subjective". Believe it or not, I have two examples.

1. Many [anarcho-capitalist purists](faction_ancap) [argue](shane_utilitarianism) that property rights must be an absolute overriding any other moral value [because all other concepts of morality are somehow "subjective"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AspFfALQSsU&feature=youtu.be&t=119). Of course, their [claimed logical derivation for it](https://mises.org/library/argumentation-ethics-and-liberty-concise-guide) [falls apart with the tiniest smidge](https://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2013/12/hoppes-argumentation-ethics-argument-refuted-in-under-60-seconds/) of [intellectual honesty](/protagonism/conscience).

2. I've seen a number of people do the same thing with game design. I can think of two people, [Chris Wagar](https://critpoints.net) and [mrguy888](https://reddit.com/u/mrguy888), who believe that [depth](/game_design/depth) and determinism are the only objective values of game design because everything else is subjective, and thus dismiss a priori any arguments that a game element is poorly designed for any other reason. (To avoid slander, Chris Wagar has not raised this argument against others to my knowledge; though he's strongly implied he believes it in the comments [here](https://critpoints.net/2017/09/14/hollowingembering-in-souls/).)

	Of course, this demarcation is just as arbitrary as that of anyone else who uses the "your opinion" cliche, because even depth is technically person-relative since a culture or individual who finds the game mechanics intituively pre-solved will experience less depth, and there's nothing any *more* relative about other game design values, like the idea that [failure should not have persistent consequences](/game_design/punishment). Games exist to provide enjoyment, and psychology isn't an arbitrary mess.
