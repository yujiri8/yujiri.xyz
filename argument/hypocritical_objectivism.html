<p>
Hypocritical objectivism is a term I'm coining for axiological positions or arguments to the effect of "the thing I value must be the only objectively valuable thing because all other values are subjective". Believe it or not, I have two examples.

Many anarcho-capitalist purists argue that property rights must be an absolute overriding any other moral value because all other concepts of morality are somehow "subjective". Of course, their <a href="https://mises.org/library/argumentation-ethics-and-liberty-concise-guide">claimed logical derivation for it</a> <a href="/protagonism/conscience">falls apart with the tiniest smidge of intellectual honesty</a>.

I've seen a number of people do the same thing with game design. I can think of two people, <a href="https://critpoints.net">Chris Wagar</a> and <a href="https://reddit.com/u/mrguy888">mrguy888</a>, who believe that <a href="/game_design/depth">depth</a>, and things related to it, like balance, is the only objective value of game design because everything else is subjective, and thus dismiss a priori any arguments that a game element is poorly designed for any other reason. (To avoid slander, Chris Wagar has not raised this argument against others to my knowledge; though he's strongly implied he believes it in the comments <a href="https://critpoints.net/2017/09/14/hollowingembering-in-souls/">here</a>.)

Of course, this demarcation is just as arbitrary as that of anyone else who uses the "your opinion" cliche, because even depth is technically person-relative since a culture or individual who finds the game mechanics intituively pre-solved will experience less depth, and there's nothing any <i>more</i> relative about other game design values, like the idea that <a href="/game_design/punishment">failure should not have persistent consequences</a>. Games exist to provide enjoyment, and psychology isn't an arbitrary mess.
