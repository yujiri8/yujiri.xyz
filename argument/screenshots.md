DESC It's trivial to fake a screenshot of anyone saying anything in any context on the internet. Screenshots prove nothing.

I lurk and comment in a lot of online political circles, so I've seen a fair amount of the wars of lies and character assassinations that go on in them. I'm going to point out a simple and obviously provable fact that if people would realize would do a lot of good for the world: **having a screenshot of someone saying something on the internet proves NOTHING.**

Look, I'm not normally the kind of person who would use caps like that, but this just makes me so mad, especially since it's [been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HY-_gi2lBY) [used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pP8jVr2CY0) [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IJMNtv-YfA) character-assassinate some people I admire and that do a lot of good like Esoteric Entity.

I wouldn't even need to be proficient to be an image editor. Browsers have something called devtools. I can use them to fake anyone saying anything in any context in 5 minutes. It only takes a low level of technical knowledge. People who want you to believe something are willing to lie, and if it's easy to do that then they'll fucking lie. Especially when the lie is an accusation of someone else lying, for god's sake people stop turning into fucking mindless drones every time you see a goddamn image.

For all I know Eso and friends very well could've faked all their images. Faking video would be a lot harder from what I know but I don't doubt it can be done with a little knowledge. It does make me suspicious that Eso seems to present his evidence as conclusive, but the other side's "evidence" is ALL a joke and the fact that they can't do anything but character assassinations corroborates this. Even besides, that the fact that Eso and friends are [anarchists](/protagonism/anarchism) makes them significantly more trustworthy than other people just by itself, because it shows that they are, at least in one way, more loyal to reason than to the cult of violence they were raised to believe in.

Honestly, you see this same shit pulled against flat Earthers. I've seen people be like "Here's this image of the Earth I found on Google Images eat shit you retard". Irrationality is frustrating enough but the most frustrating thing is when the irrational people flame you for not being irrational in the same ways as them using those very ideographs. And no I'm not a flat Earther.
