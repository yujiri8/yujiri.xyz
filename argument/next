Sneaking premises
	?? Is this a superset of loaded question?

Read-only fallacy
	No longer sure what I meant by this. I guess I meant not allowing your opponent to take things back.

Meanness is often motivated by sadism - maybe mention in inflammation

Decide your goal
	Are you aiming to convince your opponent?
		Be nice. Agree with them wherever possible and appear (sincerely or not) to sympathize with their position. Never show anger, don't act superior.
	Are you aiming to make your opponent look like an idiot?
		Be sarcastic and condescending, pick on their fallacies relentlessly, use stealth insults as much as possible, flaunt your confidence.
	Are you aiming to make yourself look really nice and amicable?
		Be nice on the surface, but be difficult and bait out insults and anger so you can win on PR by acting calm.
