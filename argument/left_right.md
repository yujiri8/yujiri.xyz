DESC It might be helpful to pinpoint exactly what ideas are being conflated in left-right.

I've long said that the terminology of "left/liberal/democrat versus right/conservative/republican" in American politics bugs me because each side of that alleged spectrum isn't a single idea, but a random amalgamation of unrelated ideas artificially lumped together.

I was right, but I think it might be helpful to pinpoint exactly what ideas are being conflated on the left-right axis. There seem to be five different conflicts, and they're found together so often just because of local [groupthink](https://yourbias.is/groupthink) and self-perpetuating parenting.

### Axis 1: Equality versus peace.

<div class="indent">

Leftists tend to despise the rich, underappreciate [markets](/protagonism/market), and favor increasing degrees of [forced](/protagonism/enforcement) redistribution, while rightists are better (but still bad) at [valuing consent](/protagonism/luck).

This goes outside of government. It's not a hard rule, but leftists often favor artificial equality that disregards individuals' differing merit, while rightists are more disposed to judge individuals on their actions even if their actions are unequal.

</div>

### Axis 2: Gender roles.

<div class="indent">

Rightists tend to believe that [gender](/protagonism/gender) has some kind of divinely ordained meaning (even if they wouldn't put it that way) and that it determines to a significant extent what role a person should play in society and in their relationships.

Leftists rejects gender roles.

</div>

### Axis 3: The [perversion of sex](/protagonism/impurity).

<div class="indent">

Rightists tend to believe that any type of sexual activity not between an adult man and an adult woman and formally recognized by an authority (usually a church, or the government for an atheist rightist), or outside of a lifelong, exclusive commitment to a special relationship, is inherently and extremely depraved.

Most leftists, on the other hand, believe sex has no special value and is a way of deriving pleasure like any other. They'll often defend pornography, prostitution and such even from peaceful disapproval.

However, leftists still usually abhor pedophilia, even if [it's totally consensual on both ends](/protagonism/age_of_consent).

</div>

### Axis 4: Gender identity.

<div class="indent">

Leftists believe in the concept of gender identity as a thing separate from sex and that people should be considered to be of the gender they identify as rather than the one they were born as. Most or many leftists also believe that gender identity is a choice, and it's cruel to ever criticize that choice for any reason.

Rightists generally don't believe gender identity is a valid concept.

</div>

### Axis 5: Partisan counter-bigotry.

<div class="indent">

Leftists insist that there's (in America) serious widespread bigotry against women, non-whites, non-heterosexuals, Muslims, and the disabled. Rightists tend to perceive American society as mostly non-bigoted.

Whatever the fact of the situation, many leftists are so attached to fighting perceived bigotry against those groups that they are counter-bigoted against the "dominant class" of white, straight, cisgender, non-disabled males. And I'm not just talking about the [double standard on physical assault](/fiction/sexist_tropes) that you see quite often even outside of movies (conservatives seem to be just as guilty of excusing that); some liberals [are *way* worse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v11wfp8vmrM) (be prepared for explicit content if you follow that link).

</div>

Libertarians, far less often discussed, tend to have all of these axes right except axis 3 (where you can often [hear them glorify pornography](https://youtu.be/AspFfALQSsU?t=119) and even prostitution). I think this is because "libertarianism" is the only one of these labels that actually maps to a single idea: self-ownership (or in [Protagonist terms](/protagonism/virtues), the valuation of consent as close to the only moral value). Libertarians are the most consistent, although to really be [consistent in that idea](/argument/faction_ancap) you have to be an [anarchist](/protagonism/anarchism).
