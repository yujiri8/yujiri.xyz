DESC It might be helpful to pinpoint exactly what ideas are being conflated in left-right.

I've long said that the terminology of "left/liberal/democrat versus right/conservative/republican" in American politics bugs me because each side of that alleged spectrum isn't a single idea, but a random amalgamation of unrelated ideas artificially lumped together.

I was right, but I think it might be helpful to pinpoint exactly what ideas are being conflated on the left-right axis. There seem to be five different conflicts, and they're found together so often just because of local [groupthink](https://yourbias.is/groupthink) and self-perpetuating parenting.

### Axis 1: Equality versus peace.

<div class="indent">

Leftists tend to despise the rich, underappreciate [markets](/protagonism/market), and favor increasing degrees of [forced](/protagonism/enforcement) redistribution, while rightists are better (but still bad) at [valuing consent](/protagonism/luck).

This goes outside of government. It's not a hard rule, but leftists often favor artificial equality that disregards individuals' differing merit, while rightists are more disposed to judge individuals on their actions even if their actions are unequal.

</div>

### Axis 2: Gender roles.

<div class="indent">

Rightists tend to believe that [gender](/protagonism/gender) has some kind of divinely ordained meaning (even if they wouldn't put it that way) and that it determines to a significant extent what role a person should play in society and in their relationships.

Leftists rejects gender roles.

</div>

### Axis 3: The [perversion of sex](/protagonism/impurity).

<div class="indent">

Rightists tend to believe that any type of sexual activity not between an adult man and an adult woman and formally recognized by an authority (usually a church, or the government for an atheist rightist), or outside of a lifelong, exclusive commitment to a special relationship, is inherently and extremely depraved.

Most leftists, on the other hand, believe sex has no special value and is a way of deriving pleasure like any other. They'll often defend pornography, prostitution and such even from peaceful disapproval.

However, leftists still usually abhor pedophilia, even if [it's totally consensual on both ends](/protagonism/age_of_consent).

</div>

### Axis 4: The invention of gender identity.

<div class="indent">

Opposite to their rhetoric about gender being unimportant, leftists see gender as a psychological "identity" chosen by the individual and [you're a hateful bigot](/argument/fizzy_trans) if you ever suggest that changing your "gender identity" [is a less-than-admirable thing to do](/protagonism/gender).

Rightists do not invent a fake concept of gender as separate from sex.

</div>

### Axis 5: Partisan counter-bigotry.

<div class="indent">

Leftists insist that there's (in America) serious widespread bigotry against women, non-whites, non-hereosexuals, Muslims, and the disabled. Rightists tend to perceive American society as mostly non-bigoted.

Whatever the fact of the situation, many leftists are so attached to fighting perceived bigotry against those groups that they've developed some degree of counter-bigotry against the "dominant class" of white, straight, cisgender, upper-class males. And I'm not just talking about the [double standard on physical assault](/fiction/sexist_tropes) that you see quite often even outside of movies (conservatives seem to be just as guilty of excusing that); some liberals [are *way* worse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v11wfp8vmrM) (be prepared for explicit content if you follow that link).

</div>

Libertarians, far less often discussed, tend to have all of these axes right except axis 3 (where you can often [hear them glorify pornography](https://youtu.be/AspFfALQSsU?t=119) and even prostitution). I think this is because "libertarianism" is the only one of these labels that actually maps to a single idea: self-ownership (or in [Protagonist terms](/protagonism/virtues), the valuation of consent as close to the only moral value). Libertarians are the most consistent, although to really be [consistent in that idea](/argument/faction_ancap) you have to be an [anarchist](/protagonism/anarchism).
