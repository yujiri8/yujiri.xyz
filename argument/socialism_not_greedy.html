DESC Neither philosopher is inherently greedier. Stop looking at only one side of the comparison.

Virtually all [capitalists](https://www.heritage.org/progressivism/commentary/socialism-the-true-gospel-greed) [mock socialism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROX10g0ZQxY) for being greedy and "entitled", on the basis that socialists see themselves as entitled to other people's property. This characterization is illegitimate because while a poor socialist appears greedier than a poor capitalist, a rich socialist thinks the poor are entitled to his property (let's assume a non-hypocritical one) while a rich capitalist thinks he is entitled to keep it all. On the whole, neither philosophy is greedier.
