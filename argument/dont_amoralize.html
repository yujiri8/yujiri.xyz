[This tweet](https://twitter.com/numbalum89/status/1101503042095116288) is a perfect example. This guy is criticizing the [abusive nature of conventional schooling](/protagonism/children), but his argument does nothing but shoot himself in the foot. He implies that the problem with conventional schooling is that it was designed for an older world, that it's 'outdated' rather than that it's inherently abusive. By raising this argument instead of an objective moral criticism, he is actually implying that conventional schooling is *not* abusive to children, because if it were there would be no reason to bother with such an inane criticism.

Don't amoralize your moral arguments.
