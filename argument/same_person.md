TITLE Not the same person?
NAV Not the same person?
TEMPLATE DEFAULT

There's an occasional trope in fiction where a character who's done something really bad and reforms is said by themselves or another character to be "not the same person who did those things", and therefore absolved from guilt even if they haven't made up for it yet.

This is one of the least harmful bad ideas, but it's still wrong. They *are* the same person and repenting doesn't automatically clear you of past guilt. [Restitution](/protagonism/property) is still owed. I hope someone who reads this will shake their head at the trope the next time they see it.
