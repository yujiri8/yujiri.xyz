DESC Nations are not responsible for actions so they can't owe debt. If anything, they owe it to their own citizens.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBb6Dh234TE">"National debt"</a> is a popular buzzword used by
<a href="/protagonism/left_right">conservatives</a>, but it doesn't exist.
</p><p>
Firstly, the concept itself is incoherent, because to owe a debt means to have taken from someone else,
but <a href="/protagonism/group_identity">only individuals can be responsible for actions</a> (and
multiple individuals only if each one contributed to the taking), and therefore a nation cannot owe a debt
because it cannot own property or commit actions.
</p><p>
Secondly, if we put aside the incoherence of the concept and assume that "America" owes trillions of dollars,
<i>to whom</i> does America owe this money? It never seems to be explained when conservatives babble about this.
</p><p>
Following from that, what did America do to accrue this debt? For the debt to exist America must have
<i>taken</i> equivalent value from this entity.
</p><p>
If some elected officials did plunder trillions of dollars from other countries (remember, that has to mean
some specific people inside those countries), that still doesn't implicate me because I didn't vote for
them or ask them to do it. I can't even be considered a recipient of the theft because the government's actions are
forced on me against my will and are easily a net negative. I'm a victim of the US government, not their
debt-paying slave.
</p><p>
And besides that, when I was born the "national debt"
<a href="https://www.thestreet.com/politics/national-debt-year-by-year-14876008">was already in the billions</a>;
if you want to tell me that I'm responsible for mistakes made not only by people other than me but <i>before
I was born</i>, then fuck off and good day to you.
