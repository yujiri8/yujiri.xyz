TITLE Polymorphic Values - And Why You Should Avoid Them

<p>
In my jocular <a href="/prismata/absorberquiz">Prismata "What Absorber Are You?" quiz</a>, I gave the deliberately BS
question, "Do you value unity or diversity more?"
</p><p>
Unity and diversity are polymorphic values: due to the <a href="connotations">emotional subtexts</a> attached by our
culture, most people perceive both as ideographs. But these concepts can mean many different things in different contexts: unity
in the software industry could mean standarization of an interface and therefore compatibility, or alternately it could mean
monopoly; within a source code repository it could mean standardization of style which doesn't directly impact function but has
aesthetic appeal and avoids distracting programmers; in philosophy it could mean a belief set having a clear central idea and
therefore elegance; in social contexts it could mean teamwork or it could mean <a href="/protagonism/group_identity">group
identity</a> and even <a href="/protagonism/leftist_economics.html">communism</a>/<a href="/protagonism/anarchism">democracy</a>.
</p><p>
There may appear to be a common thread between all those things that we could call "unity". But regardless of whether there is
one, some of those concepts are good and some are bad. Sometimes they're at odds with each other. What's not ambiguous is the
fact that unity without further specification should not be judged to be "good" or "bad". It's a polymorphic value and using the
word in our thoughts is dangerous because it can lead to trying to attach the same judgement to all of these different things.
