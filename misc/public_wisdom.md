DESC Whatever you believe, post it in public, and just before you do, you'll probably realize how it's wrong.

A rather interesting truth I learned from my late teenage years, especially from making this website, is that considering saying something makes you wiser.

I'd written several articles on [Protagonism](/protagonism/) on my own computer, in preparation for the day I'd finally put up the website. But when I did... I realized they were kinda shit. Many of the ideas I had, I believed them sincerely but I wouldn't blame someone for thinking they were crazy. Even if they'd seemed solid and obviously correct to me before, just *considering* saying them to other people made me realize which parts seemed crazy.

Ever since then, and even before then in retrospect, I've experienced that every time I write something, the anxiety of being about to send it causes me to become wiser.

So if you have any ideas you haven't told anyone... consider my advice: post them in public somewhere, and just before you do, you'll probably realize some weak points.
