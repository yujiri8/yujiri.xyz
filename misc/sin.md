DESC I have no trouble saying "no, I shouldn't do this, but I will". It's just sin. It's perfectly normal.

I think most people have a giant emotional inhibition to *admitting* to themselves that they're doing something wrong, so they have to lie to themselves that it's justified. I don't. I have no trouble saying "no, I shouldn't do this, but I will". It's just sin. It's perfectly normal.

I'm much more conscious of the possibilities of myself as evil. Most people think they're good and that most people are good and that the few evil people that exist are fundamentally different from good people. At least, they think *they* could never be an evil person. They can't imagine what it would be like to be evil.

I could turn evil. I could just make that decision - or at least, there have been times when I could've. I even came pretty close once, and not under what would've seemed like a huge trial. I know fully well that I am already evil, and it's just a matter of degree. There's nothing forcing me to play for Team Good. It's just a matter of how evil I choose to be.

To some people this makes me untrustworthy, but the upside is that I'm under no delusions about my nature. I have a much healthier mind because I don't have to fill it with lies. Other people need self-deception to sin, and I don't, but that caused other people to master self-deception.
