TITLE At Their Mercy
DESC We live at the mercy of every institution we interact with, and it's disgustingly undignified.

* [Our email providers have the power to take control of all of our accounts at any time](/software/forgot_password), and the *only* way to stop them is to self-host your email.

* The first time I went to receive a COVID test, the authorities took away my passport while I was there. Then they told me to sign something saying I'd received an information handout. I told them I hadn't received it, and they told me to sign anyway because they would give it to me upstairs. They never did.

* Most of us - myself included - rarely or never read terms of service. When I do read them, I almost always find that they grant a corporation the right to do almost anything to me. And I sign it anyway because I know they probably won't and people I need to deal with require me to use the service.

* Paying for things with a debit card usually involves giving a website or store full access to all the money in our account, and we just hope they don't abuse it.

* Any web service, even ones that store your money, can arbitrarily revoke your access under claims of "suspicious activity" and your only hope is an "appeal process". This happened to my partner multiple times with Amazon, and happened to both of us with Paypal.

* Renting an apartment via the mainstream rent system usually involves leaving an extra month's worth of rent with your landlord, in the hope of getting it back when you leave. It also usually involves paying a non-refundable fee *just to apply*.

We live at the mercy of every institution we interact with, and it's disgustingly undignified.

Solutions to many of these are easy to imagine and even to implement. Websites could allow you to provide a key to encrypt password reset emails, or to disable such emails (as [Didact](/didact) currently does). There's no legitimate reason why anyone ever needs my passport in their hand. Online banking could have been designed such that you generate a one-time code that only allows withdrawing a certain amount and enter that in an online store. That would be a little more difficult to implement for in-person payments, but trivial for online payments.

If we want a world where we don't have to live at the mercy of every fucking institution we interact with, we need to do the same thing one has to do to enact any kind of large-scale change: every little thing we can. One step was writing this article. Another was writing my article years earlier on the problem with password reset emails, and then acting on it by giving Didact the option to disable them. There are other things I could do but haven't yet, like switching most of my money to cash and paying that way at stores (I plan to do this soon). There's a lot of things you can do too. One of them is sharing this article.
