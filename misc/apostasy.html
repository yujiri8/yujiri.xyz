DESC The story of my journey out of the Catholic church, through years of self-deception and hiding, and finally to autodidactism.
MARKDOWN

I was raised in a Catholic household in a Catholic parish with next to no interactions with non-Catholics. Nowadays, I abhor Catholicism even more than [materialism](/protagonism/metaphysics). I think it'll be some combination of cathartic for me and interesting for someone else to write up the story.

I was never a very good Catholic. Me and my siblings had what I believe is far more than an average amount of physical fights, and I always stood by my actions. I was a [retributionist](/protagonism/retribution) from my first breath and never fell for "turn the other cheek" or "it doesn't matter who started it" (the former I didn't hear until I was older; the latter was raised verbatim regularly).

My family wasn't very devout during my first twelve years (we never prayed the Rosary, and I think we started going to confession when I was about ten). So although I outright believed in revenge, I was never really pressed about it.

I think things started to change when I was 12. I figured out [the free will refutation of the materialist account of the mind](/protagonism/metaphysics). It took me only about 5 seconds after noticing it to be fully convinced, and I've never once doubted it after that. In fact back then something incredible happened: I convinced my younger sibling. It was even easy. Of course, I was the only one who stuck with that during later years. Needless to say, I drew immense hostility from the others for that as soon as each one found out.

I think I was still 13, but I might have been 14, when things really got moving. My older brother left the church. During the timespan both my older siblings had moved out and there wasn't as much fighting, so I didn't view my siblings as enemies anymore. That was the first time it really occurred to me that there was such a concept as *not* being a Catholic. Although, my older brother hadn't left because of disagreements but because he "didn't want to do what God says", this was still a religious awakening that had me realize that being a Catholic, let alone a devout one, was both important and not a given.

Probably as a result, I began to think a lot more about my religion, and run across more of the errors in it. As with retribution, I dismissed each error I found in church doctrine as "not really church teaching, it must just be misunderstood and the Catholic doctrine is actually supposed to be what I believe" (I did actually find a Catechism paragraph that made this argument relatively defensible for retribution). But most of the times I knew on some level that the Catechism would tell me I was wrong and so I convinced myself I didn't need to consult it because I was so sure. When even that became untenable, my self-deception went as far as me deciding the Catechism in my house was written by bad bishops in the employ of the secular, anti-Catholic conspiracy, and essentially that I was the only real Catholic in my life. Ironic.

I had a phase where I gradually noticed that I didn't feel allied with other Catholics. When someone identified themselves as a Catholic, I thought "Right, another fake Catholic who believes Satan's lies". I noticed that I felt more comaraderie with atheists than with Catholics. I felt like an infiltrator at the Mass, surrounded by traitors and led by a traitorous priest.

Original sin was the doctrine that pushed me over the edge. I wasn't responsible for Adam and Eve's sin, there was no reason baptism should be necessary to cleanse me of it, and I was done deceiving myself. The Catholic religion really was wrong.

Even that wasn't sudden. I did have a phase of uncertainty, where I noticed how guilty I felt praying with other Catholics, saying words I didn't believe. But I couldn't deny it for more than a day after that. The other Catholics weren't the traitors. I was. And I stood by it.

One image I'll always remember was the moment where I think I really crossed the border. I was looking into a heavy rain in my familiar yard, and without Jesus, the same tree I thought was beautiful before now looked hostile. I was a child who ran away from home that day into a world I knew nothing about, and [without a perfect being holding my hand](/protagonism/theists), the world was a frightful place.

And for the first month after I left Catholicism internally, I still told myself that it had to be *close* to the truth; the truth still had to be related to Judeo-Christian history. Of course it was easier to think the arbitrary beliefs and customs I'd spent most of my life believing in weren't without any basis in the truth. I did a *lot* of research on the SSPX in the hopes of finding no doctrinal error and joining them, and even a little bit of looking into Islam. Surprisingly, it didn't really occur to me to learn more about Judaism. But now that I was free of the mental chains of Catholicism, I was rapidly throwing out more and more of their beliefs that I had only held onto because I had to, and the SSPX and Muslims seemed like mere variations on the amalgamation of shit I was raised with. I knew after a while that no prominent religion was right.

And for multiple years after that I kept my apostasy a secret from my family. I was so terrified of the consequences. I thought they'd see me as an outcast from the family as well. Would I be able to have a conversation with them anymore? How would they react to a second son of theirs leaving the church, and instead of being sorry like the first one had (I don't know if he came back before or after this), I'd be telling them I was right and they were bad people for not leaving to? How much arguing would I have to do? Although I stood by my beliefs without any doubt, I knew I couldn't explain them well under pressure, and besides they'd be disgusted no matter how well I justified my beliefs. I still valued my relationship with my older brother and didn't want him to turn hostile.

Those entire years lived under a false identity are one of the biggest regrets of my life. I considered it a sin to go to Mass and pray to the god who didn't exist. I actually kinda considered it sacrilege. How much did I miss out on by lying to everyone? I had to avoid religious conversations for fear that one of the contradictions of Catholicism would be exposed and I'd have to choose between profaning my belief in reason and conscience or coming out. I knew it was my duty to tell the truth, and I considered it a sin every day I didn't, but, I wasn't brave and I had come to terms with that.

One of the factors that led to me coming out was realizing how many hours I must've wasted going to Mass and saying the Rosary with everyone. Thousands? What could I have accomplished if I had been honest from the start? With all that freed time, how many words of novels could I have written? How much could I have learned in the way of useful skills?

Finally, I came out to my family and the results were, to put it how I felt at the time, incredibly unimpressive. There was barely any reaction. No one tried to argue with me. I was actually insulted that my older siblings didn't. Did they think I was too irrational to be convinced, did they know *their* beliefs were irrational, or did they just not care about their religion?

Regardless, what I'm certain of is that Catholicism is a horrific religion with almost no truth in it, and that deceiving yourself is always wrong, and that deceiving others is also wrong, and that telling the truth makes you more powerful in multiple ways. I've also learned a lot from my experience about the malicious genius of Catholicism and how cleverly this religion manipulates and impairs the minds of its followers. I'll write more about it some time.

Core insane philosophies
	Statism

	Original sin
		Sins cannot pass from ancestors to their descendants.

	Deontologism
		This philosophy is utterly senseless and I have trouble thinking of
		a single example where it can be twisted to seem to align with conscience.

	"Turn the other cheek"
		My conscience tells me that this is wrong.

	Hylomorphism
		AKA materialism.

Contradictions
	The trinity is a contradiction. Are they separate beings or not?
		-- You could defend this one too. They're identical, and so effectively one being, but distinct.
			-- No, that doesn't explain the differences.
			A person is precisely a self-contained being; a person is not a facet of a being.

	Transubstantiation is a contradiction. This one doesn't get enough attention. The doctrine is that
	it's "physically" bread (I don't think many of them deny that the molecules are bread molecules) and
	yet "truly" the body of Christ, but unfortunately for them a body is precisely a physical manifestation
	and so if the Eucharist is not physically a piece of flesh then it is cannot be the body of Christ.
		-- Huh, actually you could defend this a bit. "Body" by metaphysical definition.

	"God is love" is a contradiction. Probably many Catholics can be forced to admit that this isn't literally
	true, but the way they use the phrase makes it really seem like they do mean it literally.

Spirituality
	The church is authoritarian.

	The church's list of virtues and vices are a dung pile.

	The church wants to you to pray for god to give you virtue instead of actually acting virtuous.

	The church scientificizes theology. You can "study" theology at Catholic schools.

	The church advocates imprisonment.

	The church values life wrongly.

	The church does not believe in conscience. (read the ccc)
	"Conscience needs to be informed by the teaching of the church." You're not born with it;
	it's a learned thing from external training. That's literally the definition of instinct!
	These people do not believe in conscience!

Miscellany
	The christian god as described in the bible is obviously evil.

	The church provides no satisfying answer to the question of why their god doesn't do anything.

	The church is sexist.

	The church spends money on purely cosmetic things for their churches like stain-glass
	windows when there starving people in the world.

Prayer
	Prayer is just a convenient way for the faithful to convince themselves
	that they're doing something when in reality they're just standing by
	watching evil run rampant and not doing anything about it.

	Being a monk or nun is evil for the same reason prayer is.

	Speaking of which, why exactly are there different religious orders that are all considered
	valid by the church? What happened to their pervasive attachment to <a href="/argument/polymorphic_values">"Unity"</a>?

	The church provides no satisfying answer as to why the priesthood is necessary.

Particular actions of the Catholic church
	The church is full of undignified, meaningless touchy-feely fluff. For extreme examples, see the hymns they sing every week.

	The church places restrictions on when, where and how the faithful are allowed to evangelize.

	The church advocates the 'little way'.

	The church has some weird fear of "magic".

	The church doesn't want its followers in contact with contrary material and people,
	as evidenced by the index librorum prohibitorum. This can only be because they're
	afraid of reason, because if you're right then you have nothing to fear coming in contact with error.

	The church has a holy book that it's followers aren't required to read in its entirety.
	This just doesn't make any sense. How can you call yourself a believer if you haven't
	even read the book the religion derives most of its doctrines from?

You can't know Aquinas is wrong because you haven't read him!
By that logic you can't know he's right until you read everyone who disagrees with him. Unless you're willing to
believe him and me can be right at the same time.
