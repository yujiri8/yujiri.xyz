DESC It's not chronological because it was never meant to be a personal voice for me, at least not primarily.

This site's organization is different from most other sites that serve a similar purpose. It's not chronological like a blog, because it was never meant to be a personal voice for me, at least not primarily. It's meant to be an up-to-date, organized database of philosophical truth. That's why I often edit and reorganize old articles instead of making new ones, like bloggers do. Of course it covers some non-philosophical topics, like [Prismata strategy](/prismata/), but even that section isn't chronologically organized and I'd still be regularly editing old posts if I still played [Prismata](/reviews/prismata). That's also why I delete articles of mine when I decide they aren't saying anything that calls for an article, even if I don't think they're wrong.
