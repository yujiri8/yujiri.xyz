DESC Exploiting bugs is not a speedrun. A speedrun involves actually playing the game.

I've seen a few "speedruns" that were heavily liked and didn't seem to have comments calling them out despite being completely and obviously illegitimate. One example was [this claimed completion of Portal in 13:47 and with 15 portals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwCY_Bwx3-g). Um, no. So I watched it.

I mean come on, the person who plays the first chamber glitches multiple objects through the wall before leaving the relaxation vault.

I don't know what the "players" are doing to move at several times the speed your character actually moves at, but whatever it is, it's not part of the game's rules. Later they use a physics glitch to scale a wall by rapidly dropping and picking up an object.

Their description proudly claims "No scripts, hacks or cheat protected commands were used in this run". I guess you could say exploiting bugs doesn't count as any of those? Doesn't make it a valid speedrun to play by none of the same rules as actual players. By these people's logic, it counts as a speedrun if you glitch straight from the first room to the end.
