I'm a programmer, writer, and philosopher of all things. I post all kinds of stuff here:

[Didact](didact) - an anti-CMS that does the busywork without taking away your flexibility

[Sanemark](sanemark) - a saner dialect of Markdown

[Spem, the philosopher's conlang.](spem/)

[Protagonism](protagonism/) - my "religion" if you could call it that.

[Argument](argument/) - insights on debating and the psychology of argument, arguments and rebuttal I've made, debunkings of random bad but popular ideas.

[Software content](software/) - Unix and Python tutorials, reviews, programming philosophy and rants. Not actual software I've written.

[Prismata content](prismata/) - I used to play this game devoutly, and wrote a lot of beginner guides and stuff.

[Music](music/) - I used to make some, although I don't anymore.

[Game design philosophy](game_design/) - many people think that different people enjoy different things and so all judgements of games are just than personal preferences, but I don't subscribe to that nihilism.

[Storytelling philosophy](fiction/)

[Reviews of games and stories](reviews/)

[My works](works/) - DDLC mods and poems.

[Miscellany](misc/) - Personal ramblings, stories, and secure contact info.

I post programming stuff that's not appropriate for this site on [dev.to](https://dev.to/yujiri8), and DDLC content and a few random Python tutorial videos on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmTi4rq5oOp2S9UER0BH3sQ).

This site wouldn't be what it is without my dedicated contributor main_gi. He's been my de-facto editor for a long time, helped me with CSS troubles, found two vulnerabilities in my comment feature, and even contributed valuable insight that got me to change some beliefs. His page is [here](https://igniam.xyz).

<summary>Recent update log</summary>

**October 14:**
My beliefs about transgenderism actually changed a while ago, but I didn't get around to editing my relevant articles until recently, partly because the issue is more nuanced than I thought when I wrote them and I had a harder time deciding exactly what they should say. But it's done now. See [new version](protagonism/gender).

**October 9:**
I actually removed the Gold spec, a draft for a hypothetical ideal programming language I'd posted. Since learning [Rust](software/rust), my ideas have changed a lot. Many ideas from Rust are much more attractive to me now: ownership and immutability by default, and monadic error handling instead of exceptions. Also, most of my ideas for Gold were things that have appeared in other languages, so if I want to describe what I want to see in a language, I could just list the names of the ideas, not write a spec.

Update: I also removed the anarchist memes. I'm proud of some of them, but a meme dump page didn't fit [this site's purpose](misc/structure).

**October 1:**
New: [Self-aware sin](misc/sin).

**September 31:**
New: [Crystal review](software/crystal).

**September 18:**
New: [Notes on operating systems I've tried](software/oses).
