I'm a programmer, writer, and philosopher of all things. I post all kinds of stuff here:

[Didact](didact) - an anti-CMS that does the busywork without taking away your flexibility

[Sanemark](sanemark) - a saner dialect of Markdown

[Spem, the philosopher's conlang.](spem/)

[Protagonism](protagonism/) - my "religion" if you could call it that.

[Argument](argument/) - insights on debating and the psychology of argument, arguments and rebuttal I've made, debunkings of random bad but popular ideas.

[Software content](software/) - Unix and Python tutorials, reviews, programming philosophy and rants. Not actual software I've written.

[Prismata content](prismata/) - I used to play this game devoutly, and wrote a lot of beginner guides and stuff.

[Music](music/) - I used to make some, although I don't anymore.

[Game design philosophy](game_design/) - many people think that different people enjoy different things and so all judgements of games are just than personal preferences, but I don't subscribe to that nihilism.

[Storytelling philosophy](fiction/)

[Reviews of games and stories](reviews/)

[My works](works/) - DDLC mods and poems.

[Miscellany](misc/) - Personal ramblings, stories, and secure contact info.

I post programming stuff that's not appropriate for this site on [dev.to](https://dev.to/yujiri8), and DDLC content and a few random Python tutorial videos on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmTi4rq5oOp2S9UER0BH3sQ).

This site wouldn't be what it is without my dedicated contributor main_gi. He's been my de-facto editor for a long time, helped me with CSS troubles, found two vulnerabilities in my comment feature, and even contributed valuable insight that got me to change some beliefs. His page is [here](https://igniam.xyz).

**March 12:**
New articles:

**March 3:**
*HUGE drumroll* Didact is ready for use! And this website is now powered by it!

I feel so fulfilled! I finished a dream project with technologies I like!

**February 27:**
Gee, it's been a while.
New: [Separate communication and notification](software/separate_comms_and_notifs).

**January 31:**
* New: [Survival advice](misc/survival_advice).
* Deleted the article on my discord debate in Fizzy's server. I used to keep it up for historical interest even though my position changed, but blah, [historical interest is outside my scope](misc/structure).

* A guest article from terepy: [Damage formulas](game_design/damage_formulas).

**December 23:**
Spem conlang: the open question on degree modifiers question has been resolved with the addition of `ŋor` and `ŋur`. A new article explains [the theory behind the new words](spem/degree_modifiers).

**December 17:**
Updated my article on [borders](protagonism/borders). I wrote it back when I had the impression that a lot of legitimate anarcho-capitalists believed in borders and I gave the arguments for borders way too much credit. The issue is really one-sided and all the pro-border arguments are hypocritical and inconsistent.

New: [The Definitive Anarchism Rater](misc/anarchism_rater)
