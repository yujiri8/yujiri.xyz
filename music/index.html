I don't write music anymore, and I was never very good at it, but I did write a few things I'm proud of.
</p>
<h4>A New Hope In The Lands Of Snow</h4>

<p>Okay, I know the title is kinda a ripoff of Star Wars, but it fits the piece, right?</p>

<h4>Exhilarating Victory</h4>
<audio controls preload="metadata">

<p>A generic victory theme.</p>

<h4>Canticle Of Ice</h4>

<p>
This one originated as a tribute to my first novel, Odyssey Of The Elements. I was planning to make a song for each of the eight elements, but this was the only one to get finished before I scrapped the novel. Ice was the element of serenity and rationality.

<h4>An Epic Struggle</h4>

</audio>
<p>
This one is probably the oldest one on the list, surprisingly. It was intended to be the boss fight music for a sort of a now-abandoned JRPG I was making several years ago about another now-abandoned novel, The Black Wars.

<h4>An Epic Confrontation</h4>

<p>This one was going to be played in pre-boss fight conversations and such.</p>

<h4>The Pensive Warrior</h4>

<p>And here we have the Yellow Punishers' peacetime theme from The Black Wars. In that story, there were six warring factions, each associated with a color - the Black Knights, the White Guards, the Yellow Punishers, the Green Serpents, the Red Slayers, and the Blue Mediators.</p>

<h4>The Way Of Peace</h4>
<audio controls preload="metadata">
	<source src="the_way_of_peace.ogg" type="audio/ogg">

<p>The Blue Mediators' peacetime theme.</p>

<p>This one and the seven following were part of a Dungeon Synth album I made after being inspired by the work of artists like <a href="https://erang.bandcamp.com">Erang</a> in that genre. I'm more embarrassed than proud about most of these, but I thought I'd post them anyway.</p>

<h4>Meditating In The Mountain Stronghold</h4>
<audio controls preload="metadata">
	<source src="meditating_in_the_mountain_stronghold.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
	<p>Couldn't play this file :(</p>
</audio>
<p>The two Mountain Stronghold tracks were inspired by an experience I had many years ago while playing The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. I was walking on a mountain range in a blizzard, heading back to Frostcrag Spire after an adventure to deposit my spoils, and as I gazed off into the distance I began to have
this inspiration. Frostcrag Spire represented the Mountain Stronghold.</p>

<p>If you're going to make fun of the title, you can piss off, okay?</p>

<p>Finally, I've also made remixes/covers of 12 catholic hymns. <a href="/protagonism/apostasy">I was raised catholic</a>, and while I abhor the religion, a few of the hymns melodies stuck with me. Most of these play a plain cover of the original notes first, followed by the remixed notes. I don't think these are good or anything; I'm putting them up mostly for historical interest.</p>
