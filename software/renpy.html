<h1>How Renpy and I met</h1>
<p>
I got into Renpy after playing <a href="/reviews/ddlc">Doki Doki Literature Club</a>, a visual novel made with it.
DDLC is far and away the best story I've ever seen and had such a huge impact on me than it was the first game I ever
played mods for. There's a large modding community and they've come up with some really great extensions to the story.
After playing a few (I got lucky and tried most of the best ones first), I was finally motivated to make one myself.
</p><p>
Hence came <a href="/kaliruk/mc_revenge">MC's Revenge</a>, a project I picked up from another modder who abandoned
it for adoption. I finished MCR and the reception was good, so not long later I took up a much larger project that I'd
actually been planning while I was making MCR, <a href="/kaliruk/return_to_the_portrait">Return To The Portrait</a>.
</p><p>
RTTP is a lot more ambitious and has required me to deal with Renpy in a lot more depth, so I've gotten to see the
ugly complexities. Currently RTTP has had part 1 released and I'm working on part 2. So that's my experience with Renpy.
</p><p>
Okay, this is going to be kind of an unfair review because I'm only counting my grievances. That's genuinely how I feel
about Renpy - I just never encountered anything that worked better or more easily than I expected. This is probably
because I've never used any other VN engine, so I don't know, maybe Renpy isn't below average. But I do know that it
has a lot of weak areas, many of which don't seem like they would've been hard to implement better.
</p>
<h1 class="bad">Complex character sprites aren't well supported</h1>
<p>
You can't dynamically generate pose tags; instead you have to hardcode all the ones you're going to use during init.
</p><p>
They've got the <a href="https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/layeredimage.html"><code>layeredimage</code> statement</a>
as an attempt at a more sophisticated way of handling character
sprites, but it's got a slew of its own problems. It makes your tags insufferably long since each component has to
be space-delimited <i>and</i> have a unique prefix typed out everywhere you use it, it doesn't support composing
other layered images as far as I can tell, and it seems
to cause incorrect image composition (some layers appear with lines of pixels missing between them that worked with
hardcoding <code>im.Composite</code>), and so despite how badly I need this feature for RTTP and how many hours I've
sunk into trying to make it work, I've ended up not using it.
<!--
and more critically, when you have optional slots with the <code>layeredimage</code>
approach, setting a pose code without an option for a slot doesn't erase the currently drawn option.
-->
</p><p>
A good visual novel engine would be designed with the assumption that a character will have too many possible poses to hardcode
them all, so it would support using a function that converts the posecode as a string to whatever object the VN engine takes
for its <code>show</code> statement.
</p><p>
This inadequacy is the whole reason u/AgentGold had to write the 1800-line <code>Create_Definitions.pl</code> for DDLC modders.
Implementing pose codes better would have saved most if not all of that tremendous amount of work, as well as hundreds of lines of
<code>image</code> declarations in almost every VN made with Renpy. It would free developers and their artists to create more
flexible and more expressive character sprites.
</p>
<h1 class="bad">Too many DSLs... that all do the same thing</h1>
<p>
I'd expect to run into at least one DSL for a visual novel engine. Script language makes sense.
But Renpy has two DSLs besides script language and the <code>layeredimage</code> language:
<a href="https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/screens.html">screen language</a>
and ATL (<a href="https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/atl.html">animation/transformation language</a>),
and neither of them is simple or intuitive.
</p><p>
In screen language, you give each button an <code>Action</code> attribute, and the <code>Action</code> is always syntactically
treated as a Python function call. Even the <code>NullAction</code> used when you want a button to do nothing is specified with
<code>action NullAction()</code>.
</p><p>
The worse problem I have with screen language is that a lot of it seems to just be duplicating the functionality of either
Python or Renpy script. <a href="https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/screen_actions.html">Built-in Actions</a> include
<code>Call</code>, <code>Jump</code>, <code>Show</code>, <code>Hide</code>, <code>Return</code>, <code>SetVariable</code>, <code>NullAction</code>,
<code>If</code> (it takes a condition / action if true / action if false)... any of those sound familiar? There's a screen
language version for just about every Renpy script statement I can think of, which is just capitalized and has different
syntax. (Note that you also use actual Python flow control constructs in screen definitions, and even outright embed
Python code and use variables, so I'm honestly not sure if there's ever a need for <code>If</code>.)
</p><p>
You also can specify multiple actions by passing a <i>Python list</i> of actions to the <code>action</code> attribute, even
though you don't wrap it in a list if there's only one. This is a shining example of why convenience shortcuts can be harmful:
if you're learning by example like I was, you see an action specified without brackets and naturally assume that passing a
Python list would be either a syntax error or a TypeError. If single actions had to be wrapped in brackets, the readability cost
of finished code would be minimal and Renpy would be more self-documenting. Although to be fair I'll admit this point is
arguable. I'm saying it because it's going to be important in a second.
</p><p>
And there's a lot more to this myriad of redundancy and confusion.
Buttons in screen language can be made to show up but not be clickable with their <code>sensitive</code> property. <i>Or</i> this
can be done by using the <code>SensitiveIf()</code> action - <i>as a member in a list of actions</i>. Because <i>that</i>
makes sense. (I learned this way of doing it first, which led me to believe that it was the only way because it's so
obviously the worst that I don't think anyone would choose it if they knew any other way.)
</p><p>
Similarly, there's a Python equivalent for almost anything Renpy script does. <code>renpy.image</code>
can be used from a <code>python</code> block (which embeds literal Python code in script) as equivalent to the
<code>image</code> statement, for example. But the Renpy way is almost always clearer and better, because, of
course, that's how it was made to be used.
</p><p>
This all flies in the face of "<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020">There should be one-- and preferably only
one --obvious way to do it.</a>" Having this kind of ambiguity only confuses me and forces me to wonder what the difference
is and which one I should be using.
</p><p>
Renpy's the best demonstration I've seen of why <a href="features">features are
bad</a>. Even after working with Renpy for over a year and getting experience with almost every major area of functionality,
there are still a <i>lot</i> of things I don't understand about it, and I never will since with any luck I'll never have
to work with Renpy again after I finish Return To The Portrait.
</p>
<h1 class="bad">ATL doesn't support blocking animations or even uncancelable ones</h1>
<p>
Okay, so ATL has this distinction between <i>transformations</i>, which are for transforming or moving a sprite, and
<i>transitions</i>, which are for defining how to transition between two images. Usually transitions are used for things
like scene fades.
</p><p>
Apparently transitions are always blocking and transformations are always non-blocking. This is a reasonable default but
isn't wanted all the time. The inability to do non-blocking transformations wouldn't be a huge deal, but here's the worse
problem with transformations: since they're non-blocking, they get interrupted and left unfinished by subsequent animations
depending on how quickly the player moves through.
</p><p>
There's not apparently a way to tell Renpy that a transformation should be instantly completed if it gets superseded
(I went on the Renpy Discord and asked about it and got that response from the creator).
You wouldn't believe the shitty ways I've had to come up with to hack around this in Return To The Portrait.
In the original DDLC Dan used an approach of having every single use of a character animation in the script specify
both their destination position and their destination status (normal, focused, sunk). But that approach couldn't
really work for my script since I had too much nonlinearity. There are scenes where a large block of dialog plays out
the same regardless of a previous choice, but that choice does change which position a character is at, and so if I'd
done it Dan's way I'd have littered every such scene with a vomit-inducing amount of if/else branches.
</p>
<h2 class="bad">ATL doesn't support flow control</h2>
<p>
Of course, ATL is the only DSL that's not only well-designed enough to not reinvent Python flow control with its
own unique syntax but also to <i>not support Python flow control</i>. If you want to do branching in ATL logic,
you have to find some hideous workaround like having two different transforms and the decision logic actually
be in the script.
</p>
<h2 class="bad">ATL doesn't support non-idempotent animations</h2>
<p>
You normally use the <code>pos</code> properties to set positions. The <code>offset</code> properties
(basically <code>pos</code> that can't take a fraction of the screen dimensions) are independent of those
and could be used to work around this in some situations, but they still have to be idempotent, so at
best this could work if you know you'll only need to nudge the character once.
</p><p>
And there's another problem with trying to use <code>offset</code> to get around this: since they're independent
and transforms don't touch any properties they don't mention, if you later apply a transform that only sets
<code>pos</code>, <code>offset</code> will stay how the previous one left it.
</p><p>
So pretty much, if you ever want to animate a character moving a specified distance instead of to a specified position,
you have to keep track of their position. And you know what that means if your script is non-linear...
</p>
<h2 class="bad">ATL doesn't allow mixing relative and absolute positions to the same property</h2>
<p>
ATL parameters interpet position as absolute pixels if it's an int, and a proportion of screen width if it's a float.
But of course this means you can't mix them. Want to show a character at 100 pixels to the right of the middle of
the screen? Too bad, cause <code>xpos 0.5 + 100</code> would mean <code>xpos 100.5</code> - 100.5 times the screen
width.
</p><p>
It's worse than that. That limitation's at least understandable why it's that way, but you can't even mix them in
different places in the same transform. For example,
</p><pre class="code">
transform test:
    xpos 200
    linear 1 xpos 0.5
</pre><p>
will make a character appear at 200 times the screen width and move to the middle over 1 second.
</p><pre class="code">
transform test:
    xpos 0.5
    linear 1 xpos 100
</pre></p>
makes the character appear at half a pixel in and move to 100 pixels in. So apparently it just goes by whichever is last.
</p><p>
Again, in some situations you could use <code>xoffset</code> to get around this, but that's a timebomb for a few
fun hours debugging when you add a transformation that needs to not touch <code>xoffset</code>.
</p>
<h2 class="bad">
ATL doesn't support defining the duration of an animation based on moving at a constant speed rather than the total duration
being a constant
</h2>
<p>
I don't think I need to elaborate here. It's not needed that often, but this would've been the first thing I'd think of if
I wrote the ATL specification.
</p>
<!--
<h2 class="bad">
<code>default</code>, <code>define</code>, <code>init python</code> and <code>python early</code> are all very confusing
</h2>
<p>
The documentation on most (not all) of these is <a href="https://www.renpy.org/dev-doc/html/python.html">here</a>, .
</p><p>
And besides <code>init python</code>, there's a statement called <code>python early</code> that's mentioned in the documentation,
but seemingly never explained - I searched for it for about twenty minutes. Just before giving up on finding out what it does
I found <a href="https://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums/viewtopic.php?t=4045">a forum thread</a> where PyTom answers the question.
Couldn't we have at least called it<code>early python</code> to be consistent?
</p>-->
<h3 class="bad">Persistent object returns None on accessing undefined fields</h3>
<p>
No, that's really what happens. <a href="javascript">Javascript</a> has infected Renpy. Goodbye run-time typo detection.
</p><p>
This isn't even how Python objects work. Someone presumably added extra code to make the global
<code>persistent</code> object behave in a non-standard, useless and bug-prone way.
</p>
<h3 class="bad">Can't use <code>expression</code> in some cases where you need to be able to</h3>
<p>
Renpy's script language has a lot of statements that take an identifier, like <code>show</code> which of course
takes the name of an image. If you want to have these statements branch without doing massive trees of explicit
<code>if</code>s everywhere, you've got the <code>expression</code> statement, which will make the name be interpreted
as a Python expression that evaluates to the name of a Renpy object.
</p><p>
But there are some situations I've often wanted to have <code>expression</code> in where it conveniently isn't valid
syntax, such as with the <code>at</code> clause in a <code>show</code> statement (which specifies a transform).
You can use <code>expression</code> to determine what image to show, but not what transform to show it with.
