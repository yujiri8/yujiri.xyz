MARKDOWN

Defined in [RFC 6797](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797), HSTS is a standard that extends the ideas of HTTPS by making it impossible to connect to a website over unsecured HTTP. But section 12.1 of the standard, "No user recourse", reads:
```
Failing secure connection establishment on any warnings or errors
(per Section 8.4 ("Errors in Secure Transport Establishment")) should
be done with "no user recourse".  This means that the user should not
be presented with a dialog giving her the option to proceed.  Rather,
it should be treated similarly to a server error where there is
nothing further the user can do with respect to interacting with the
target web application, other than wait and retry.

Essentially, "any warnings or errors" means anything that would cause
the UA implementation to announce to the user that something is not
entirely correct with the connection establishment.

Not doing this, i.e., allowing user recourse such as "clicking
through warning/error dialogs", is a recipe for a man-in-the-middle
attack.  If a web application issues an HSTS Policy, then it is
implicitly opting into the "no user recourse" approach, whereby all
certificate errors or warnings cause a connection termination, with
no chance to "fool" users into making the wrong decision and
compromising themselves.
```
So they're saying not just that the browser should warn when you try to connect over HTTP, but that it should *not offer you a choice*, even though there's no technical reason why proceeding is impossible. And indeed the browsers have implemented this; Firefox and Chromium both won't *allow* me to connect if there's a cert error.

The reason I oppose this is that it represents a betrayal of principles and a flagrant breach of respect for the user. Implementing this means taking away people's control of their own devices. If security designed to protect "me" requires me not having a choice, something is wrong with the underlying philosophy.

[An excellent quote from Linus](http://quotes.cat-v.org/programming/): "... If you think your users are idiots, only idiots will use it." Unfortunately, this time, even the smart people have no choice but to use it.

Luckily, `curl` and `httpie` can be used to circumvent this, but that I need them to get out of my browser to do so is absurd.

It's for the same reason [I oppose programs that don't allow running as root](why_root), but at least most of those programs allow a flag to override it.
