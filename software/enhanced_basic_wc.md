NAV Against "enhanced" basic web components
DESC I think "enhanced" versions of basic web components are a mistake. They add complexity, bugs, download size, and are unnecessary.

So browsers have `<button>`, `<input>`, `<select>` and all the other essential UI elements as built-in, styleable components. Admittedly they don't look very nice. But one thing I hate about the trajectory of the web ecosystem is the fad of "enhanced" versions of these, like most of [the MWC components](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-components/). There's an `<mwc-button>`, an `<mwc-textfield>` (equivalent of `<input>`, because why not rename a couple of them too for extra confusion), an `<mwc-textarea>`, `<mwc-formfield>` which basically fills the purpose of `<label>` but is less flexible (it can't contain HTML), and a whole bunch more.

Before MWC, at my job we used the Polymer components: `paper-*`, `iron-*`, and `app-*` stuff. They were nice: they looked nice, they were a nice fat sack of dependencies, and the users liked 'em. But they're deprecated and we're trying to switch to the new MWC stuff. The new MWC stuff looks nice, is a nice fat sack of dependencies, has different interfaces and the users like them. But they've also introduced some issues.

Like [the ugly hack we've had to come up with to make `<mwc-textarea>` autoexpand](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-components/issues/455#issuecomment-574330528). We've applied that hack in several places, and one day it stopped working after we updated minor versions and its internal HTML structure had changed, so I spent an hour to figure out how the hack needed to be amended. This does also require [a Javascript fix](https://github.com/yujiri8/yujiri.xyz/tree/master/js/src/util.js) for the native element, but it's much simpler and won't break when your library updates.

This whole fad is disgusting. Maybe it's a "good" decision in marketing terms to [sacrifice simplicity, stability and performance](https://yujiri.xyz/software/features) for a fancy look. But the world would be better if we all just stuck to the built-in components, and one of two things would happen: either the browser vendors would implement nicer default styling, or users would learn to not mind them. Kind of a prisoner's dilemma, maybe.
