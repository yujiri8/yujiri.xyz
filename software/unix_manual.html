TITLE How To Read Unix Manual Pages
NAV Unix manual pages
TEMPLATE DEFAULT

<p>
Unix manual pages can look like an illegible mess if you're not used to them. The SYNOPSIS section at the top lists the syntax
of the command; the syntax of this listing itself calls for some explanation.
</p><p>
Stuff inside brackets is optional. Usually these are flags.
</p><p>
Things with a bar between them are alternatives - they're mutually exclusive.
</p><p>
Underlined words that are not bold <expand-note> (if you're not on FreeBSD the text style might differ from what
I'm saying but it'll be consistent across the system)</expand-note> are not to be typed
literally; they're descriptions of parameters. For example, the synopsis:
</p><pre class="code">
<b>dosomething</b> [-f | -q] [-w] <u>file</u>
</pre><p>
means the command is called <code>dosomething</code>, and it takes an argument which should be the name of a file.
The command supports three flags: <code>-w</code>, <code>-q</code>, and <code>-f</code>; <code>-f</code> and <code>-q</code>
are mutually exclusive. Exactly what each flag does will be described in the rest of the command's manual page.
</p><p>
<code>...</code> means multiple things can be put here. If the <code>dosomething</code> command's synopsis had said:
</p><pre class="code">
<b>dosomething</b> [-f | -q] [-w] <u>file ...</u>
</pre><p>
That would mean you can pass it more than one filename and it'll do whatever it does to all of those files. (Almost all
commands allow this.)
</p><p>
Sometimes the synopsis is also specified in multiple parts, like:
</p><pre class="code">
<b>dosomething</b> [-f | -q] [-w] <u>file ...</u>
<b>dosomething</b> -h
</pre><p>
This would mean that the command can be used like above, or it can be used as just <code>dosomething -h</code> with no other flags or
operands. (Usually if a command has a <code>-h</code> flag, it stands for 'help' and causes the command to print a short
description of how to use it instead of doing anything.)
</p><p>
There's <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi">a web version of the FreeBSD manual pages</a>, and it looks much
nicer, but you still need to know the synopsis syntax.
</p>
<h2>Manual sections</h2>
<p>
There are manual pages on more than just usable commands. The manual is organized into a number of sections, with section 1
usually being for general commands and section 8 being for system administration commands. Section 5 is for information about
file formats, sections 2, 3, 4, and 9 are for C programmers, section 7 is for "miscellaneous information" (section 6 is "games"
but that's a misleading name).
Normally the <code>man</code> command will search all the sections and show you the first one that matches the
argument you specify. If you want to only search for pages in a specific section, you can do something like <code>man 1 ls</code>
to search for a page on something called <code>ls</code> in section 1. The <code>-a</code> flag will show all the matching
pages found in sequence (as opposed to just the first one).
</p><p>
When we want to talk about a specific manual page by section, it's standard notation to write <code>ls(1)</code>, to
specify that we're talking about the page on <code>ls</code> in section 1, incase there are pages called that in other
sections.
