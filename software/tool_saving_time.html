DESC Tools like Markdown have made writing more pleasant and more efficient, but do they truly outweigh their costs?

When I first launched my website, I hand-wrote every line of HTML. HTML is ugly and verbose, but there weren't any other options, or so I thought.

I don't know how long after that it was that I first found out about markdown. I'd seen the `.md` files in some places but didn't understand why they had extension and I had no clue they were for processing into HTML. I first sought out a Python markdown processor when I implemented my comment feature. I found [python-markdown2](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2) and ran with it. It was great.

It wasn't long after that that I decided I wanted to use it for my articles too, so I instituted a new template directive for my source files to request markdown processing. This way the old HTML articles could stay while I wrote new articles in markdown and converted the old gradually or not at all.

So markdown's generally made me much happier and more efficient... or so I thought. After running into more and more issues with python-markdown2, I eventually started searching for a replacement. The search consumed so much time and was so frustrating that I managed to make [a 5-part dev.to series about it](https://dev.to/yujiri8/the-quest-for-a-better-markdown-processor-31og) before I resigned to lowering my criteria for success and switching to [mistune](https://github.com/lepture/mistune), despite all of its own issues.

This experience has got me thinking: *has markdown actually helped me?* Sure it's saved me a small amount of time and happiness writing each article since, but how much time has it *costed*? As a ballpark, the search probably costed me 12-18 hours in total. Originally finding and plugging in python-markdown2 probably took only 1, but struggling with the issues before I started searching for replacement might've been another 12 (I struggled with [this one](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/issues/342) for a *long* time before I took to reading the source and finally resorted to editing it. It delayed the initial publishing of [The Concise Python Tutorial](https://yujiri.xyz/software/pythontut1) by two days if I remember correctly).

I should also count the time spent looking for a way to *unmarkdown* old HTML articles. (I convert them occasionally, and I think I've done about half of them as of this writing.) I did a few manually, which was tedious, and then found [soffes's unmarkdown](https://github.com/soffes/unmarkdown), which despite being a Ruby library I ended up using. It still requires manual conversions in some cases (likes for links I had given `rel="nofollow"`). Add the time it took me to learn enough Ruby to make a script that wrapped that library into a CLI tool (which is almost none, but might be another hour), and I might've spent another 6 converting old HTML articles to markdown.

There's no way the benefits have added up to about 30 hours yet. Will they, given the difficulties aren't over? What else could I have done with these 30 hours if I had never looked into markdown?

And yes, I *needed* some sort of formatting capability for comments without allowing full HTML, but lots of other comment systems (Wordpress, Disqus) use HTML while stopping dangerous stuff like `<script>`. I don't like it, because it's uglier and more verbose and non-technical users probably find it more confusing, but it was an option.

There's no way I'm ever switching away from markdown now. The 30 cost is paid, and besides that I have too much of an emotional attachment to markdown to ever go back to garish HTML. But I have to wonder if it was a detriment in the grand scheme of things.

I used markdown as the example here, but I think it applies to other tools too. What if many of our favorite productivity tools are actually not pulling their own weight?

Times like this are when I feel stronger than ever that we should [kill software for great glory](https://yujiri.xyz/software/kill_software). Here I am wondering if it costed me, but when I consider how much time the library authors put into this, it starts to look like an absolute tragedy. I have a hard time believing the total cost of inventing, specifying and implementing markdown has been recouped, or ever will be.
