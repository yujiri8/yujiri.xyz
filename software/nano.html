It seems to be a common opinion among experienced Unixers that <a href="https://nano-editor.org">Nano</a> is a low-featured text
editor meant for newbies and not suitable for advanced users. While I acknowledge I don't know that much about Vim or Emacs (the
usual alternatives advocated), I respectfully suggest that these people are basing their belief on not knowing what Nano has to
offer. I'm a proficient Nano user and although there are a few ancillary features I miss in Nano, it's really a good editor, and
let me explain why.
</p><p>
One of the biggest points I want to make is that even though Vim has some features I'd certainly like to have in Nano (number
+ navigation key to move a number of units), I think Nano makes up for it by having the most common functions be
significantly faster to access than in Vim. (Of course, this part of the comparison is somewhat moot because in either editor
these can be customized, but having good defaults still matters.)
</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Example: how do you save your file?</b></dt>
<dd><p class="bg-good">
	Nano: ctrl-s. Two keypresses that don't even have to be strictly in sequence. One just needs to start before
	the other. It's barely slower than one keypress.
	</p><p class="bg-bad">
	Vim: esc, shift-colon, w, enter. <i>Five</i> keypresses. And the first one is an out-of-the-way key that you
	don't already have your finger next to! (At least on a qwerty keyboard.) And you also better not still be
	holding down shift when your finger hits w or it won't work.
</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>
This one may have more value to me than it does in general since I've developed a habit of impulsively saving the buffer
every time I've made a change and aren't immediately sure what to type next, but I don't imagine I'm the only one with some
degree of save-happiness.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Example: how do you switch buffers?</b></dt>
<dd><p class="bg-good">
	Nano: alt-comma or alt-period. Again, two keys that aren't much slower than one.
	</p><p class="bg-bad">
	Vim: esc, shift-colon, b, the number of the buffer you want, enter.
</p></dd>
<dt><b>Example: how do you open a new file in the current editor instance?</b></dt>
<dd><p class="bg-good">
	Nano: ctrl-r. (With the default configuration you'll have to follow it with alt-f or it'll get read into the current
	buffer, but really what are you doing with your life if you didn't set the config option to fix that.)
	</p><p class="bg-bad">
	Vim: esc, shift-colon, o, space.
</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>
You see where I'm going. My biggest gripe with Vim in general is the separation of "insert mode" which equates
to having to press Esc and <code>i</code> all the time to switch between command mode and insert mode instead of
putting to use the modifier keys all over your keyboard.
I'd probably sooner be persuaded to join the <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ChurchOfEmacs">Church of
Emacs</a>, so I admit it's a bit unfair for me to be basing my case for Nano on a critique of Vim when I know
even less about Emacs than I do about Vim. (I did try Emacs for a while and had some bad experiences with it, though
I don't remember enough to explain.)
</p><p>
Notable features Nano has that you might not know about (besides the help enabled by default which is
<i>wonderful</i> for letting you learn the most useful hotkeys while working) include
</p>
<ul>
<li class="bg-good"><p>
	Regex search/replace
</p></li><li class="bg-good"><p>
	Search and replace history
</p></li><li class="bg-good"><p>
	The cursor position statusbar in addition to normal line numbers
	</p><p>
	This is actually wonderful. If you enable <code>constantshow</code> in the config, you see on the bottom
	your current line number, the number of lines in the file, the percent ratio of the two, and the same
	for columns in the current line and characters in the file.
</p></li><li class="bg-good"><p>
	Macros
</p></li><li class="bg-good"><p>
	Efficient navigation hotkeys: ^A (= Home), ^E (= End), ^Y (= Page Up), ^V (= Page Down), ^W+^Y/V (top/bottom of file), M-G (goto line/column number), M-] (goto matching bracket), word-oriented move/delete (ctrl-left/right, ctrl-del, ctrl-shift-del); Smart home; alt-up/down to scroll the window without moving the cursor.
</p></li><li class="bg-good"><p>
	Selection (M-A) and almost everything (cutting, justifying, indenting) will automatically apply to just
	the selection if you have one
<!--</p></li><li class="bg-good"><p>
	Good undo/redo-->
</p></li><li class="bg-good"><p>
	Excellent facilities for multiple buffers; opening a new one is easy (you get tab autocompletion and tilde
	expansion when entering the filename), switching between them is easy, you can even execute an external
	command and read in the output, etc
</p></li><li class="bg-good"><p>
	Toggleable autoindent
</p></li><li class="bg-good"><p>
	Regex-based syntax highlighting which works by having a nice, concise, plaintext file for each language it
	supports, and it's super easy to modify or add languages. I've submitted some improvements to some of the
	default syntax highlighting modules myself.
</p></li><li class="bg-good"><p>
	Optional mouse support, though I personally don't use this
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Of course, Nano <i>is</i> missing some features I'd like to have, besides Vim's number-movement shortcuts.
</p>
<ul>
<li class="bg-bad"><p>
	No search/replace across multiple files
</p></li><li class="bg-bad"><p>
	No bracket highlighting (though it does have the goto bracket hotkey I mentioned above)
</p></li><li class="bg-bad"><p>
	<a href="https://www.debuggex.com/cheatsheet/regex/pcre">PCRE</a>. We're limited to POSIX ERE's.
</p></li><li class="bg-bad"><p>
	It's missing hotkeys to indent and unindent an entire selection by spaces. Tab will indent all
	selected lines if a selection's active (and shift-tab will unindent them), but space will just type
	a space where you are. Macros are a reasonable workaround but they're a good deal less convenient
	than having these hotkeys.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
But this brings me to another great thing about Nano: its active development! Nano gets a new release every few
months tops, and each one has great new features to bring to the table. The developer is mostly one guy by
the looks of things but he's very responsive; he's always responded to my patches within 48 hours. I remember
when I first became a hardcore fan of Nano it was version 2.9 and some of the features I mentioned up there
didn't exist. So I expect the few inadequacies of Nano to be improved in the next year or so, and if I have time
I intend to help make it happen.
