TITLE My catalog of recommended packages to install on Unix
NAV Unix packages to install
TEMPLATE DEFAULT

<p>
One of the best parts about an open-source operating system is the open-source community.
Countless wonderful software projects have been made by awesome people who wanted to contribute to
Unix or who wanted something impressive on their resume, and we all get to benefit from it.
Here I'll post every package I've found useful and recommend installing on a Unix system.
Since I'm a FreeBSD user, I'll be calling them by their FreeBSD package names, which might be different
on other systems. Most Linux distros probably have a lot of these preinstalled.
</p>

<h2>Basic terminal utilities</h2>
<ul><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://nano-editor.org">nano</a></code> - text editor. Easy to learn
	(it shows help on the bottom by default) and yet quite configurable and powerful.
	</p><p>
	Nano's often derided as primitive among experienced Unixers (editors more popular with them are
	<a href="https://www.vim.org">Vim</a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs">Emacs</a>),
	but I think this reputation's undeserved. I've <a href="nano">written more about the unsung power
	and efficiency of Nano.</a>
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://fishshell.com">fish</a></code> - "friendly interactive shell". My current shell of
	choice. The main sellings points are syntax highlighting, history-based autosuggestions, and better tab
	autocompletion without needing to install extra stuff and configure a whole bunch of crap (like you do to
	get those things with <code>zsh</code>). I've <a href="fish">written more about Fish and
	what's so great about it</a>.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://git-scm.com">git</a></code> - one of the most popular
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">version control</a> systems. I use it for all
	kinds of stuff, even besides code.
</p></li></ul>

<h2>Window manager and main graphical applications</h2>
<ul><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/Software/xorg">xorg-server</a></code> - X (the graphical window
	system) doesn't come with FreeBSD, and this is the package for it.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://dwm.suckless.org">dwm</a></code> - My window manager of choice. <code>dwm</code> is
	a tiling window manager with no desktop and is a wonderful way to use a computer productively. The only
	possible criticism of it I could see is the configuration. It needs a custom config file to be good
	(albeit it only takes a small amount of modifying the default, unlike <a href="https://xmonad.org">xmonad</a>),
	and its config file has to be compiled in, which means you <i>have</i> to build it from source. (And you
	have to rebuild it every time you change the config.) On the bright side, it builds in like 1 second.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky">conky</a></code> - a configurable tool to easily get
	system status information. Most useful as a statusbar for <code>dwm</code>.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://github.com/realh/roxterm">roxterm</a></code> - my currently preferred terminal emulator.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.mozilla.com/firefox">firefox</a></code> - Firefox web browser.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.chromium.org/Home">chromium</a></code> - Chromium web browser
	(different from but related to Chrome).
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://www.qutebrowser.org">qutebrowser</a></code> - A web browser in <a href="python">Python</a> and Qt
	with a design philosophy of keyboard-centrism and efficiency of use for advanced users. You have to give
	it a fair chance and give yourself time to learn the hotkeys.
	I like Qutebrowser, despite not being a Vim user; honestly the biggest thing holding me back from using
	it right now is that the ctrl-shift-U trick for unicode typing doesn't work in it for whatever reason.
	And I need unicode typing for <a href="/spem/">Spem</a>.
</p></li></ul>

<h2>Networking</h2>
<ul><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://httpie.org">py37-httpie</a></code>, <code><a href="https://curl.haxx.se">curl</a></code>, <code><a href="https://www.gnu.org/s/wget/">wget</a></code> - swiss army knives of HTTP (and some other protocols). <code>curl</code> and <code>wget</code> are both classics written in C; <code>wget</code> is GNU software and <code>curl</code> is MIT licensed. <code>httpie</code> is a much younger implemention in Python (also BSD-licensed) and is nicer in just about every way, but doesn't support everything the others do. I keep all three installed.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://yt-dl.org">youtube_dl</a></code> - Download videos from Youtube and a few other sites.
	Yeah, apparently this isn't illegal...
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://nmap.org">nmap</a></code> - "network mapper". <code>nmap</code> is a tool for network
	exploration and security auditing, widely known as a port scanner; the package also contains <code>ncat</code>,
	which is a more sophisticated version of <code>nc</code> that supports TLS!
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://torproject.org">tor</a></code> - The Onion Router, a network anonymity tool. I strongly
	recommend you read about this if you haven't heard of it.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://humdi.net/vnstat/">vnstat</a></code> - analyze network traffic statistics
	over long times.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://scapy.net">py37-scapy</a></code> - Python library and interactively usable program
	for sending and analyzing packets. <i>Horrible</i> documentation, but I think it is really powerful if you
	learn to use it.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://wireshark.org">wireshark</a></code>/<code>tshark</code> - Wireshark is a renowned
	packet analysis tool. It can't <i>send</i> custom packets like Scapy can as far as I know, but for receiving
	and analyzing them it's much easier to use without trawling through huge amounts of vague documentation and
	experimenting for hours. <code>tshark</code> is a terminal version of wireshark. For some horrible reason,
	you can't have both installed at once on FreeBSD, and I remember thinking Wireshark's interface was horrid.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://www.joedog.org/siege-home/">siege</a></code> - load testing tool (but HTTP/1.1 only).
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://nghttp2.org">nghttp2</a></code> - gives <code>h2load</code>, an HTTP/2 load
	testing tool. I remember thinking it wasn't as nice though. (But that's not all this package is; just all
	I know about it.)
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source.html">openvpn</a></code> - open source VPN server
	and client. I followed <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-and-connect-to-a-private-openvpn-server-on-freebsd-10-1">this tutorial</a> to set one up.
</p></li></ul>

<h2>Resources and monitoring</h2>
<ul><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://people.freebsd.org/~abe">lsof</a></code> - list open files. This might be preinstalled
	on GNU/Linux, but not on FreeBSD. It's a little different from <code>fstat</code>; I'm not sure if either can
	do anything the other can't, but I find <code>lsof</code> convenient to have.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://hisham.hm/htop">htop</a></code> - like <code>top</code>, but looks nicer (has color)</a>.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="http://www.ex-parrot.com/~pdw/iftop">iftop</a></code> - like <code>top</code>,
	but for network traffic</a>.
</p></li></ul>

<h2>Misc CLI utilities</h2>
<ul><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync">rsync</a></code> - the swiss army knife of copying and
	backups</a>. The <code>--delete</code> flag is one of the biggest things that makes it worth having over
	<code>cp</code> in my opinion.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://www.ivarch.com/programs/pv.shtml">pv</a></code> - "pipe view". Monitor progress of data
	through a pipeline. <code>cmd1 | pv | cmd2</code>
	and it pipes <code>cmd1</code> into <code>cmd2</code>, but shows you the progress.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux">tmux</a></code> - "terminal multiplexer". It has a lot
	of features I don't know about, but among them are the ability to use a terminal window in the fashion of a
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager">tiling window manager</a> and to reconnect
	to sessions that get interrupted (for example, if the network cuts out while you're using <code>ssh</code>).
	I haven't taken the time to really learn <code>tmux</code> but I want to.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="http://entrproject.org">entr</a></code> - "Event Notify Test Runner". Monitors files and
	runs a given command when they change. As of this writing I'm using it on this server.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://www.sudo.ws">sudo</a></code> - more sophisticated account permission control than
	<code>su</code>. Due to <a href="root">the way Unix treats the root account</a>, even if your
	system is single-user, this is probably worth installing if it isn't preinstalled.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code>beep</code> - beep. All the laptops I've had have had significant difficulty getting this to work,
	but on this one I managed it. One of the useful traits of this tool is that, at least on my system,
	it ignores volume (although not muting).
</p></li><li><p>
	 <code><a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a></code> - I'm not sure exactly what it stands for, but it pretty-prints and manipulates JSON data.
</p></li></ul>

<h2>Hardware and filesystems</h2>
<ul><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://www.nongnu.org/dmidecode/">dmidecode</a></code> - massive amount of info on all
	hardware. I can't think of any commonly useful information I don't know how to get without this
	command, but <code>dmidecode</code> simplifies things.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="http://cdrtools.sourceforge.net/private/cdrecord.html">cdrtools</a></code> - burn CDs
	(and do other things with them I guess).
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://www.zfsnap.org">zfsnap</a></code> - makes automatic ZFS snapshots slightly easier.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://devel.freebsoft.org/speechd">speech-dispatcher</a></code> - speech synthesis CLI tool.
</p></li></ul>

<h2>Media and file formats</h2>
<ul><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://mpv.io">mpv</a></code> - terminal-based music and video player.
	I recently discovered this and it seems to outmode both <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu">mplayer</a>
	and <a href="https://www.videolan.org">vlc</a> as far as I'm concerned.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="http://sox.sourceforge.net">sox</a></code> - "SOund eXchange" is what this is apparently
	supposed to stand for. It's not as nice as <code>mpv</code> for playing music, but it's the most
	convenient way I know of to record audio from my laptop microphone.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://ffmpeg.org">ffmpeg</a></code> - swiss army knife of multimedia manipulation.
	I've been amazed by what this tool can do.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://www.libreoffice.org">libreoffice</a></code> - open source tool that can read
	"document" formats like .xlsx, if you ever have the displeasure of needing to work with those.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="http://www.winfield.demon.nl/index.html">antiword</a></code> - convert
	<code>.doc</code> files to plaintext.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="http://www.info-zip.org/Zip.html">zip</a></code> - tool to work with the Windows-standard
	<code>.zip</code> file format.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://rarlab.com">rar</a></code>, <code>unrar</code> - tools for .rar files.
	(They're separate packages on FreeBSD.)
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://www.xpdfreader.com">xpdf</a></code> - dedicated PDF reader and manipulator.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="http://geeqie.org">geeqie</a></code> - image viewer. It's not like you need
	<code>geeqie</code> to view images, and I don't even like the program, but I find it useful for
	viewing all the image files in a directory in a single window.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract">tesseract</a></code> - <a rel="nofollow"
	href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition">Optical Character Recognition</a> for
	Unix! FOSS, and works out of the box.
</p></li></ul>

<h2>Art production tools</h2>
<ul><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://lmms.io">lmms</a></code> - Linux MultiMedia Studio, for writing music.
	Not the greatest, but it's the only free one I know of.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://www.gimp.org">gimp</a></code> - of course, the GNU Image Manipulation Program.
	Again, I have plenty of gripes with it, mostly interface-related, but it's free and quite
	functional other than that.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://scikit-image.org">py37-scikit-image</a></code> - nice image library for Python.
	This package has saved me from a lot of manual work on multiple occcasions.
</p></li></ul>

<h2>X utilities</h2>
<ul><li><p>
	<code>xinit</code> - ships the <code>xinit</code> and <code>startx</code> commands, which make dealing with X
	much simpler.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://www.nongnu.org/xbindkeys/xbindkeys.html">xbindkeys</a></code> - set keybinds in
	the X environment. Incredibly useful. Don't live your life without it.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code>xmodmap</code> - manipulate the keymap in X. Basically this should be called <code>xbindkeys</code>
	and <code>xbindkeys</code> should be called <code>xhotkey</code>.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code>xset</code> - X window system settings
</p></li><li><p>
	<code>xsetroot</code> - set the title of the "root window" in X. <code>dwm</code> uses this to set statusbar
	text, making it even easier to plug <code>conky</code> into it!
	much simpler.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="http://www.vergenet.net/~conrad/software/xsel/">xsel-conrad</a></code> - manipulate the X
	selection buffer (clipboard). (The command is just called <code>xsel</code>).
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://github.com/resurrecting-open-source-projects/scrot">scrot</a></code> - CLI tool
	for SCReenshOTs.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code>xmessage</code> - display a message in an X window. It's primitive and ugly, but sometimes this is the
	tool you need, for a script to get your attention or something.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu">dmenu</a></code> - an easy launcher solution from the
	same people that make <code>dwm</code>. The <code>dmenu</code> command by itself takes a list of options
	from stdin and displays a menu on the top where you can select one via typing, arrow keys and tab completion,
	and returns the selected option on stdout. The <code>dmenu_run</code> script it comes with is used as a plugin
	for <code>dwm</code> to make it easier to launch stuff you don't have a hotkey for without opening a terminal
	to type the command.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code>xev</code> - report X events. Enormously useful for debugging.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://www.semicomplete.com/projects/xdotool/">xdotool</a></code> - simulate key strokes,
	mouse clicks, and other X events.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code>xlsclients</code> - list X client applications (applications running in X windows).
</p></li><li><p>
	<code>xwininfo</code> - get info about an X window by clicking on it.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code>xinput</code> - get information about X input devices.
<!--
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href=""></a></code> -

</p></li></ul>

<h2>Programming and miscellany</h2>
<ul><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2">py37-markdown2</a></code> - library and CLI for
	Markdown processing. I use this for the comments on this site.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://www.gnupg.org">gnupg</a></code> - GNU Privacy Guard, a renowned encryption tool.
</p></li><li><p>
	<code><a href="https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc">cloc</a></code> - Count Lines Of Code. The advantages over
	<code>wc</code> are that it can count blank lines and comments separately from code lines, can
	automatically find just the source code files in a hierarchy, and it can separate them by language.
</p></li></ul>
