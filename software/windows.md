TITLE I hate Windows because Windows hates me

There are [good explanations of why Windows is technically inferior to Unix-like operating systems](https://www.over-yonder.net/~fullermd/rants/winstupid/4). But my virulent hatred of Windows is actually less about architecture (or even about *freedom*) and more about the offensive insults against the user that litter Windows as it currently exists:

* Ads in the start menu and on the lock screen. It's one thing when free software does this, but Windows is *paid and proprietary* software.

* Unsolicited notifications and popups about Microsoft stuff it wants me to install.

* PC starts in "S-mode", which means non-Microsoft apps aren't allowed to run.

* I changed my settings to allow installing non-Microsoft apps. Windows automatically changed it back.

* I deleted the Edge exe. Windows automatically restored it.

You don't control your own device if it runs Windows. You are treated like a guest in your own house. Nevermind the sophisticated concerns about design, or the ideological ones about software freedom. I hate Windows because Windows hates me.
