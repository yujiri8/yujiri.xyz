DESC You can see your rating by downloading the replays from Loonark's servers, or going to the Prismata Statsforge.

Want to see your rating, but can't because Loonark won't let you for no reason? No problem. This data is actually stored in the replay files on Lunarch's servers, which can be downloaded by pasting the code into http://saved-games-alpha.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/(insert code).json.gz. For easier viewing, you can just go to [the Prismata Statsforge](http://www.aimbooster.com/prismata).
