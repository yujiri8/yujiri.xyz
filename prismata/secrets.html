<p>There are a handful of "cheat codes" that can be entered into Prismata chat like chat commands (eg. /mute). I know of two: /RotatingInferno, which unlocks event units for use in custom games, and /baconIceCream, which instantly gets your account to level 15.

<p>Also, if you ever want to see the information for a unit you don't have unlocked yet, you can see them all at <a href="https://prismata.net/units">prismata.net/units</a>.</p>
