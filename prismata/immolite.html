TEMPLATE DEFAULT

<p>Immolite is an interesting unit. In a vacuum, it's very slightly stronger than Tarsier, but in practice, it can be much worse or much better depending on the circumstances. Here I'll explain how I decide which one to buy. Go through these steps in order, and once you get an answer, you stop.</p>
<ol>
<li>If Tarsier's buildtime can be taken advantage of to deny absorb: <b>buy Tarsier</b>.</li>
<li>If Immolite's finesse exploits the enemy or forces them to make sacrifices to avoid being exploited: <b>buy Immolite</b>.</li>
<li>If Immolite allows you to spend tech that you'd waste if you bought Tarsier: <b>buy Immolite</b>.</li>
<li>If Immolite doesn't force your opponent to buy prompt defense: <b>buy Tarsier</b>.</li>
<li>If Immolite forces out efficient defense (Aegis, Polywall, Plexo Cell, etc): <b>probably buy Tarsier</b>, but feel free to buy Immolite if it's more convenient.</li>
<li>If Immolite forces out medium-efficiency defense (Wall, Innervi Field, etc): <b>probably buy Immolite</b>, but feel free to buy Tarsier if it's more convenient.</li>
