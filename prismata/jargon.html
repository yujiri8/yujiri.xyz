<!--<li><p><b>Absorb</b> is the ability of non-fragile defenders to take damage and then survive unscathed, thus able to take the same damage again next turn and survive again. Absorb is extremely powerful, as <a href="https://prismatalibrary.blog/2017/12/22/the-standard-style/">307th excellently explains in his guide "The Standard Style"</a>.</p></li>-->
<li><p><b>Soak</b> is defense that is bought simply to die and not to absorb.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Threat</b> means damage or chill that your opponent doesn't necessarily want to actually deal. For example, a Drake provides 2 real damage and 2 threat.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Vigilant</b> units are ones that can block while performing some other useful function, such as Xeno Guardian which can block while attacking (note that Steelsplitter cannot).</p></li>
<li><p>Resource abbreviations: E means energy, G green, B blue, R red, and X means attack. Gold is denoted just by a number. So for example, we would say that Centurion costs 18GGBBR.</p></li>
<li><p>p1 and p2 refer to the players who go first and second.</p></li>
<li><p>BSO = Base set only.</p></li>
<li><p>Base + x means the set of units including the base set and the listed units (or the listed number of random units), eg. Base + Borehole Patroller, Base + 5.</p></li>
<li><p>The base set units are commonly referred to by the first letter of their name. Eg. T is more efficient than S. Note that some of these conflict with the resource abbreviations.</p></li>
<li><p>To refer to turn numbers, we often say things like t4, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Line notation</b>: Although many openings have names (see my <a href="openings">opening list</a>), people often still refer to them by specifying every move. So for example, to open DD/DA as player 2 is to buy 2xDrone, then Drone+Animus (this is the common opening 'Fastimus'). We can also use turn numbers to jump into the middle of a game, like: p1 should play 6: WEB there.</p></li>
<li><p>
An <b>autowin</b> is a set where one player (p1 or p2) has an unbeatable line. <a href="autowin">Technically every set is
an autowin by this definition</a>, so we usually only use it to refer to sets where no matter what the disadvantaged player does
the advantaged player's obvious moves are good enough to force the win.
</p></li>
<li><p>A <b>legendary</b> unit is a unit that has only 1 supply.</p></li>
</ul>
