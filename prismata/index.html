DESC I hope that by making these guides I can reduce the number of new players who drop Prismata.

Greetings, swarmwielder. You are very skilled. And by you, I meant me. In a moment, you'll be saying the following: I learned something there.
</p><p>
To my own sorrow, I'm not an active player anymore, as I no longer have the time to stay into a competitive game. I still have the utmost respect for Prismata and so I decided to use my knowledge as a former 2100 player (#2 on leaderboard at my peak) to help train new players. I hope that by making these guides I can reduce the number of new players who drop Prismata.
