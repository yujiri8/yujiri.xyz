DESC There are a handful of "cheat codes" in Prismata. I know of two.

There are a handful of "cheat codes" that can be entered into Prismata chat like chat commands (eg. /mute). I know of two: /RotatingInferno, which unlocks event units for use in custom games, and /baconIceCream, which instantly gets your account to level 15.

Also, if you ever want to see the information for a unit you don't have unlocked yet, you can see them all at [prismata.net/units](https://prismata.net/units).
