TITLE Why I hate TikTok

TikTok is the worst of all social media platforms. Yes, even worse than Twitter.

Before I get into this, I do *not* have a TikTok account and never have. I am not a hypocrite. My experience comes from living with someone else who does.

* The platform's design creates a culture of style over substance. Many TikToks deliver their entire message through a one-sentence caption or a text-to-speech voice, and the message is one that would make a fine post on Twitter or Mastodon, but TikTokers cannot just say a sentence; they have to add a video of their face (even though they aren't using their voice) or them dancing, and a pop song that usually has nothing to do with the video.

	Forgive me for making an analogy to [the state of the web](https://eev.ee/blog/2016/03/06/maybe-we-could-tone-down-the-javascript/).

* I've seen TikToks of people announcing they're about to be kidnapped and put in a psych prison, and in the video they are... dancing to house music?

	No judgement of the victim; they're welcome to post what they want. But it makes me feel sick.

	Nothing like this ever happens on any other platform. It's a result of the design of the platform and the culture it encourages.

* Lack of basic video controls (seek, progress bar).
