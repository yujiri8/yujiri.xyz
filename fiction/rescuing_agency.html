<p>
Having characters be rescued is dangerous for a story because it's very <a href="glory">de-glorifying</a> to the rescued
character. It even tends to come off as <a href="diversity">sexist</a> if the rescued character is female and the
rescuer male, since it's <a href="sexist_tropes">cliche to have male characters rescuing female characters</a>. But
rescues don't have to be that way.
</p><p>
To preserve the rescued character's dignity, try having them play a part in their own rescue. For example: John infiltrates the
badguy's fortress to save Sally, but as soon as he does, guards close in and surround them. It takes John and Sally's combined
power to defeat the guards and escape. Or for extra competence, the guards have strong armor that John and Sally's attacks can't
penetrate, and they're slated to lose - until Sally tricks them into standing next to the Proton Reactor. She shoots it and it
blows up and kills the guards. Either way, John has still rescued Sally, but you've done it without turning Sally into an
under-glorified damsel in distress.
