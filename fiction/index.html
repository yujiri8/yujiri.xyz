TITLE Yujiri's storytelling philosophy
TEMPLATE COLUMNS

<p>
First, I want to talk a bit about the philosophy of philosophizing about storytelling. You might think how good a story is is
subjective, and I can't claim a story is <i>bad</i> just because I didn't like it. But if you believe that then what's the point
of even talking about this stuff? If the quality of a story is subjective, then all this talk about the way any element of a
story "should" be is meaningless, so what are you even doing on this page? Now that we've cleared that up, here's my repository
of thoughts.
</p><p>
Second, I want to state that most of the below philosophies were devised before <a href="/protagonism/emotions">my
understanding of human emotions</a> was as deep as it is now (and it still is very incomplete), so any time I say something
in this section like "the three prime traits heroes need", there's a good chance I don't really believe that anymore and
my philosophy will change when I have a more complete understanding of psychology.
