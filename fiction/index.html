TITLE Yujiri's storytelling philosophy
TEMPLATE COLUMNS

<p>
First, I want to talk a bit about the philosophy of philosophizing about storytelling. You might think how good a story is is
subjective, and I can't claim a story is <i>bad</i> just because I didn't like it. But if you believe that then what's the point
of even talking about this stuff? If the quality of a story is subjective, then all this talk about the way any element of a
story "should" be is meaningless, so what are you even doing on this page? Now that we've cleared that up, here's my repository
of thoughts.
