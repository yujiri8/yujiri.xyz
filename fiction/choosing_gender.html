Two considerations. First of all, [in-story diversity is good, including in-group diversity](diversity). If there are two factions of goodguys and two characters from each, default to each one having one male and one female. Second, and more insightfully, *use cultural double-standards to pick*.

Sometimes a cultural double standard exists such that the audience's opinion of a character will vary based on their gender. For example, it's an [*extremely* widespread stereotype](sexist_tropes) that when there's a conflict between ideologies of "justice versus mercy" or "anger versus compassion", men favor justice and women favor compassion.

This means that when people see a man arguing for the retribution side in one of these situations, they're more likely to write him off with "well he's a guy, of course he's going to err on the side of being too harsh", even if only subconsciously.

Therefore, if you want to make a story that challenges our culture's [insane "turn the other cheek" ideology](/protagonism/retribution), it's a good idea to make the didactic character female. Likewise to challenge [the total reversal of that standard that appears in the context of government](/protagonism/anarchism) where mercy and giving a repentant criminal a chance to redeem himself cease to exist, make the character male.
