TITLE How to choose a character's gender in fiction

<p>
Two considerations. First of all, <a href="diversity">in-story diversity is good, including in-group diversity</a>.
If there are two factions of goodguys and two characters from each, default to each one having one male and one female.
Second, and more insightfully, <i>use cultural double-standards to pick</i>.
</p><p>
Sometimes a cultural double standard exists such that the audience's opinion of a character will vary based on their
gender. For example, it's an <a href="sexist_tropes"><i>extremely</i> widespread stereotype</a> that when there's
a conflict between ideologies of "justice versus mercy" or "anger versus compassion", men favor justice and women favor compassion.
</p><p>
This means that when people see a man arguing for the retribution side in one of these situations,
they're more likely to write him off with "well he's a guy, of course he's going to err on the side
of being too harsh", even if only subconsciously.
</p><p>
Therefore, if you want to make a story that challenges our culture's <a href="/protagonism/retribution">insane
"turn the other cheek" ideology</a>, it's a good idea to make the didactic character female. Likewise to
challenge <a href="/protagonism/anarchism">the total reversal of that standard that appears in the context of
government</a> where mercy and giving a repentant criminal a chance to redeem himself cease to exist,
make the character male.
