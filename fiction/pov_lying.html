MARKDOWN

One practice that completely ruins any otherwise thrilling scene it touches is having the protagonist keep secrets from the audience so that the audience experiences an illusion of tension where there isn't any from the protagonist's perspective. Sometimes, the writer will flash back to the scene where they received the crucial information afterward.

This practice doesn't even solve the problem it purports to solve. As soon as a self-respecting audience sees the reveal, they feel betrayed because not only can they no longer trust the writer, they can't even trust the protagonist. How are we supposed to be invested in a story when we know we've been lied to about what's happening in it?

For non-obscure works that are guilty of this, [Solo: A Star Wars Story](/reviews/star_wars#solo) and [Attack on Titan](/reviews/aot) come to mind.

Sometimes the protagonist comes up with a plan and then executes it in the next scene, and the writer doesn't want to have them explain their plan when they come up with it because then the next scene will be boring as we watch events unfold exactly as we were told they were. That's fine. Having the protagonist say they have a plan and then execute it without explaining it is fine. Having the protagonist clearly signal to the audience that they *don't have* a plan and feel cornered by the villain, and then reveal that they saw it all coming all along and actually have the villain cornered, is where it becomes audience betrayal.

<!--
I also want to mention an example of good flashbacks. Final Fantasy 13. This game uses over a dozen of them and they're all justified. They don't use them to lie to the audience; they use them to gradually reveal a lot of history for each character that would have been horrible to dump all at the beginning. The key difference is that the information they reveal in their flashbacks wasn't relevant before.
