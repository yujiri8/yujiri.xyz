<p>In this post I'm going to talk about an extremely pervasive mistake in sci-fi worldbuilding. This is the mistake of adding advanced technology, but not accounting for how it would change society. In fact nearly every popular sci-fi universe does this to some extent. Let's look at Star Wars for an example.</p>

<p>The Star Wars movies show us many advanced technologies, such as interplanetary travel, ships that can engage in cool-looking space battles, robots that are apparently people, human cloning, and of course, the iconic lightsaber. But how has their way of life changed? It hasn't.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of things that could probably be done given the other technologies we see: reviving the dead (they have human cloning after all), genetic enhancement (extra strength could be a huge help in lightsaber fights), computers implanted in people's brains that give them portable access to the internet and some sort of built-in AI assistant like modern
phones have only much better, brain implants that allow people to turn off their perception of pain whenever they want (we already have painkillers in real life), and... for that matter, why not just live in virtual reality?</p>

<p>That last one, while a lot of people might argue against it, should at least be a social issue. People could build something like the Matrix, use non-personal droids to maintain it (like the medical droids we see all over the Clone Wars), and going into it could be entirely voluntary and non-committal.
<!--Everyone in the galaxy could be in utopia if they wanted. It would even be entirely non-commital and voluntary. -->Surely at least some people would want that?</p>

<p>This is actually such a big obstacle that despite dozens of WIPs, I've only just recently come up with <a href="/kaliruk/the_pygon_hybrid">what <i>might</i> turn out to be a working sci-fi story</a>. In this
one, I decided that the <a href="/protagonism/metaphysics">human soul</a>'s "death detector" is a lot touchier than it is in real life, and so any sort of tampering with someone's brain causes their soul to leave their body (death) permanently. This solves the problems of elimination of pain and genetic enhancement.
As for computers implanted in people's brains, well, they can't actually be implanted for that reason, but people do have little wrist-mounted devices called companions that can do anything a modern computer can do and more. They use them to
process payments (the currency is digital), autorecord what's happening to them so they have proof if they get assaulted or something (which happens in the story), and, to counter this, it's become standard criminal practice every time you assault or mug someone or anything to take their companion and delete the
recording.</p>
