NAV A couple of garbage, under-criticized tropes

A couple of garbage tropes I rarely see criticized.

### Lethal training

A faction's training is "so intense that many cadets die". This is a garbage trope because that could never happen on accident. Inherently dangerous training is one thing, but training that's lethal because it's "so intense" would never be a thing because you don't die quickly from "intensity". The commander must be seeing a cadet on the verge of death and deciding to keep pushing them knowing fully well it won't result in a soldier.

Offending examples: [The Fall of Reach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo:_The_Fall_of_Reach), [Mass Effect](/reviews/mass_effect) 2 (Asari Justicars).

### Trauma or grief makes friends drift apart

So there was a band of four close friends, one of them died and that made the other three want to stop being together. Sound like how *people* work? Don't be ridiculous. Shared suffering is an extremely powerful bonding force.

This ruined the bad ending of [Doki Doki: Salvation](/reviews/ddlc_mods/salvation), and appears in [Lost Odyssey](/reviews/lost_odyssey), where the only reason it's not catastrophic is that it's in backstory and not really important.

What else doesn't get enough hate?
