TITLE What makes a good villain
NAV Villains
TEMPLATE DEFAULT

<p>Long after the publishing and expanding of my article on <a href="heroes">heroes</a>, I've finally nailed down my philosophy on villains. There are again 3 prime traits:</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Competence</b></dt>
<dd><p>The villain must be competent enough to be a challenge for the hero. Unfortunately for lazy writers, simply piling raw power on the villain doesn't do the trick. If you tell the audience that the villain is the most powerful mage to have ever existed but the hero still beats him in a 1v1 with just a few days of training, you've actually made your villain appear
	<i>less</i> competent by playing up their power. The only way to do this properly is to have the villain get things done throughout the story. You probably don't want the villain to win, but they should score some goals for team evil. Preferably let them take out a few important members of Team Good (even if the story isn't a full tragedy).</p></dd>
<dt><b>Motivation</b></dt>
<dd><p>The villain should have a reason for doing the horrible things they do. Nobody needs <a href="strawman_chaotic_evil">Strawman Chaotic Evil</a>. Good villains have a goal and it isn't to be the villain of a story. Good villains show how evil is not a far-fetched thing that only happens in stories but is actually quite a human and relatable thing that all of us are
	at least dabbling in.</p>
    <p>Note that as long as villains have a believable motive, they can be anywhere from completely evil to genuinely well-intentioned people. But you have to be very careful in the latter case to not portray them as evil. If the main person opposing your hero is a misguided good person, then the hero should treat them as such, or else they're the real villain of the story.
	People who treat innocent people as evil are evil.</p></dd>
<dt><b>History</b></dt>
<dd><p>Good villains don't come out of nowhere. They have an origin story. <span class="spoiler">Rashek</span> from <a href="/reviews/mistborn">Mistborn</a>: The Final Empire is an evil overlord with few lines similar to the Emperor from the Star Wars original trilogy, but he is <i>so</i> much better as a villain. If you don't know that book, just substitute
	Darth Vader in light of the prequel trilogy.</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that I didn't say anything about the villain needing to even be on the wrong side. That's because I consider that a failure of the portrayal of the story rather than a problem with any of the characters.</p>
<p>As I did with the heroes article, I'll now analyze some antagonists of popular stories and give them ratings on a 0-6 scale.</p>
<br>

<h3>Darth Vader</h3>
<dl>
<dt><b>Competence</b></dt>
<dd><p>In episode 4, Darth Vader kills Obi-Wan, but that wasn't much considering it was part of Obi-Wan's plan. In episode 5, he captures the heroes besides Luke and defeats Luke in a lightsaber fight, but the other heroes were led into a trap for him so that wasn't too impressive either. In episode 6, he loses to Luke and does nothing except backstab the Emperor.
       So he isn't very competent. 2 points.</p></dd>
<dt><b>Motivation</b></dt>
<dd><p>When you consider just the original trilogy, it's serviceable that he's fighting to keep his government afloat so he can continue living a life where he has basically unlimited power over everyone he meets. That's nothing special, but it works. Vader never really puts himself in personal danger to protect the Empire (it's easy to infer that he's so powerful with
       the Force he doesn't really consider it risky to be on the front line fighting rebels).
       </p><p>
       When you factor in the prequel trilogy he becomes a lot more interesting. The prequels explain his fall to evil and it's actually quite believable. His interest in Luke is because Luke is the only artifact of Padme left in the world. Naturally he wants Luke to join him so he can
       have that keepsake in his life without giving up his reign of evil. I imagine (and the Vader fanfilm did a good job portraying this) that he feels cheated by Sidious since he signed on to this whole dark side thing purely to save Padme and then he still lost her. So, when Sidious is killing Luke for not joining the dark side, it makes perfect sense that Vader
       finally gets fed up with it and kills the man who manipulated him and ruined his life to save the one person that represents everything he used to love. He did it to make Padme proud. It's actually kind of a beautiful resolution when you think about it. 6 points.</p></dd>
<dt><b>History</b></dt>
<dd><p>I don't think there's any way to argue against giving him a 6 here. The prequels add so much depth to this character. Of course, it's a bit unfortunate that George Lucas had to make six movies about the same person to give him this depth - the real challenge is to make a character this fleshed out in just one or a few movies - but the end product is good, no matter how
       much went into making him.</p></dd>
<p>Average: 4.67. Not the best score you can imagine, but quite good.</p>
</dl>

<p>I thought about putting Darth Sidious, Darth Maul, Grievous, Snoke and Sauron on here, but there just isn't anything to say about any of them. That's how bad they are. None of them have a motive, all of them die in or before their first real fight, and Sauron doesn't even have any lines. These villains are jokes - or rather, I wish they were.</p>

<h3>Rashek (from <a href="/reviews/mistborn">Mistborn</a>: The Final Empire)</h3>
<dl>
<dt><b>Competence</b></dt>
<dd><p>There's nothing that impressive about him having taking over the world, given that he had the dirty cheating combination of Allomancy and Feruchemy at his disposal to do it with. And other than that, he never really accomplishes anything. 3 points, because at least he doesn't really fail at anything either.</p></dd>
<dt><b>Motivation</b></dt>
<dd><p>Rashek knew about Ruin and how the world was doomed if he played by conventional methods. So, he installed himself as a totalitarian dictator to prevent anyone from messing up his plan to keep Ruin at bay, intending to live forever and eternally watch over the atium stash, so that the world could continue to exist. This is actually very similar to Saren's motives: he
       basically gave up on really beating evil and made the world a horrible place as a compromise to prevent everyone from dying. While you can criticize his plan, it's still a great motive. 6 points.</p></dd>
<dt><b>History</b></dt>
<dd><p>Alendi's logbook and the rest of the trilogy tell us how Rashek came to power, why he killed Alendi, etc, but it's not quite as good as Darth Vader, since we only know about it from historical retelling which doesn't relay any of what he was thinking or feeling at the time. It would have been really cool to explore Rashek's thoughts as he fell from grace.
       5 points.</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>Another 4.67, since he's one up from Vader on competence but one down on history. This is a good villain that other writers should learn from as an example. He was fleshed out mostly in one book, and the rest in the two sequels in the same trilogy, so it's a more realistic example to look at than Vader.</p>

<h3>King Zerik (from <a href="/kaliruk/pillars_of_life/index">Pillars of Life</a>, my own novel)</h3>
<dl>
<dt><b>Competence</b></dt>
<dd><p>His prisoners escape and he doesn't really get a chance to do anything smart (since he's not actually the main villain, just the one who sort of serves as the window into Team Evil's minds). He does get one fight before he dies though and does quite well, killing four of the eight heroes ganging up on him. I think he deserves a 3.</p></dd>
<dt><b>Motivation</b></dt>
<dd><p>Zerik is the only one here who goes the full self-aware evil but not chaotic strawman route. He knows he's evil and he's okay with that. Still, he gets lonely being evil and having no one "woke" to talk to, so when two of the heroes are caught by the government he secretly keeps them around as prisoners instead of executing them in the hopes of talking to them. He even
       tries to be "nice" by giving them a huge cell with privacy and plenty of food. He genuinely enjoys talking to them and playing games with them. He sees them as "friends" (in an incredibly messed up way), and wants them to see him the same way.
       </p><p>
       Despite how insane that looks from a naive goodie's perspective, it actually makes perfect sense in light of a true understanding of human psychology. Although he's chosen to embrace evil, he still admires the heroes and finds their perspective intriguing as the only real good people he's ever met.
       He just wants them to follow him into evil so they can all leave behind hostility and discuss stuff with a fully enlightened perspective, and he can't bring himself to give up on this pipe dream. More than this, he seems like he might truly be a pretty fun guy to hang out with if he didn't have power over you to abuse.
       </p><p>
       The final point that makes him really satisfying is his pseudo-redemption. During their captivity, one of the heroes was always trying to convert him, and he expressed shock and gratitude at the offer, but refused. Then in the final battle, while he still fights against the heroes and makes one last comment about how being good isn't worth it, his final act is leaking
       the Voren telepathy secret - giving the heroes a huge advantage in the coming battle if they defeat him. The heroes discuss this and point out that it doesn't make him a good person, since he didn't really pay a personal cost to do this except the small factor of distracting himself briefly, but it's still interesting. Could he have been redeemed if things had gone
       differently? Maybe if the heroes had talked to him instead of starting the fight immediately? How close might he have been?
       </p><p>
       The upshot is that Zerik nails the objective of showing how even pure and unsympathetic evil is not an unrelatable or needlessly destructive thing, he simply wants to have fun and doesn't mind hurting innocents to do so. 6 points.</p></dd>
<dt><b>History</b></dt>
<dd><p>He has no character-specific history. We know that the Voren came from another land, but he doesn't reveal anything about it because he doesn't even remember it - he took his own memories to extend his life. That excuse only covers me though and not him. He still gets a 0 here.</p></dd>
<p>Average: 3. The villains of Pillars of Life were never supposed to be its strongpoint, in my defense. But he's still much better than a lot of other popular villains (see Star Wars, Lord of the Rings).</p>

<!--

Count Dooku:
 Competence: Well, at least he defeats Anakin and Obi-Wan together. That's better than Darth Vader ever did. And then he holds his own against Yoda! Unfortunately, he dies very early in his second movie, so that's all he really gets.
 Unrootability: While he's also working for a government, so are the designated goodguys this time, so we can't really count that against him. And we never really see him do anything bad onscreen. So Count Dooku is actually sorely lacking in vices. In fact, the separatists are given a lot of credit in some of the
  Clone Wars episodes, not to mention the Jedi order <a href="/protagonism/jedi" target="_blank">has a lot of flaws</a>, so it's not crazy to think Count Dooku might actually be the relative goodguy here.

Darth Sidious:
 Competence: Holy shit, this guy maniupulates a hero into becoming his apprentice and then takes down the Jedi order and conquers the galaxy with just the two of them! Here is a villain who actually knows how to play the game of fiction.
  It's especially impressive that he didn't rely entirely on raw power to defeat the four Jedi masters that came to assassinate him. He actually was defeated by Mace Windu, but then used Anakin, leveraging his own ostensibly helpless position, to turn the tables. Although some fans might argue that he threw the
  fight with Mace Windu when he sensed Anakin coming to have a greater impact on him by making him be the one to strike Mace Windu, but either way it's brilliant and impressive.
 Unrootability: This is the area where Darth Sidious completely bombs. Not because he isn't evil, but because he is <b>strawman chaotic evil</b>: he has no motive. He just likes conquering galaxies and corrupting people, even if it puts him at personal risk to do so, which is not how real evil works.

<p>I would also put Kylo Ren, except that I think he might be going to be redeemed, and if that's so then I really can't judge him without having seen all of his movies.</p>
