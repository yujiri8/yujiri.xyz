  Let's see. In the beginning, he chooses to go out and look for R2, but that wasn't much. He didn't exactly choose to go with Ben to Alderaan; his family was dead and his home destroyed so he had basically no other options. Landing in the Death Star was not his decision, although going to rescue Leia was. Nothing
  about the Death Star battle was his decision. Going to Dagobah sort of was, but not really. Going to Cloud City was definitely his choice, but that was basically his only moment of agency in the entire movie. In the final movie he has much more of it; the plan to rescue Han was implied to be his, he went back to
  Dagobah freely, and chose to go confront Vader a second time. Overall, I give him a 3 on agency throughout all three movies.</p>

<dd><p>The hero must be the hero of their own story. Their choices should steer the plot. If they don't, why is the story written from their perspective, instead of someone who actually matters? This doesn't mean the hero should always be successful; on the contrary, good stories generally involve a lot of
failure. But the direction of the plot - especially the ending - should still be a result of the hero's actions.<!-- and it's important that they aren't roped in to the adventure (if they are at first it can be okay if they are soon given a chance to turn back and refuse it).--></p></dd>

  In Attack of the Clones Anakin chooses to go save his mother, but other than that, he makes basically no decisions of his own. In the next movie, he chooses to kill Dooku and then reports Palpatine to Mace Windu though, and that affects the plot plenty. So do his
  decisions to go stop Mace Windu and then to turn to the dark side. That's much better. I'll give him a 4 on this.</p>

  Not great during the main portion of the book; it's even explicitly mentioned by other characters how little control she has over things. Nevertheless she has a couple moments: making Kelsier let her come with him to Kredik Shaw (which was an awesome scene by the way), convincing Kelsier not to throw away his
  life when the army gets destroyed (and coming with him on that trip in the first place), and spending time with Elend despite being told not to. Then she becomes fully autonomous after Kelsier dies. 3 points.</p>

  Plenty. He chooses to fight Kakanas at Grand Staff, chooses to even go on the whole quest to take down Gongora, and most importantly, chooses to destroy the mirrors. 5 points.</p>

  Decent. He chooses to sneak out against curfew, he chooses to go on Leuis's mission, he comes up with the plan to crush a Voren to death. 3 points.</p>
