TITLE Some advice on action scenes in prose
NAV Action scenes
TEMPLATE DEFAULT

<p>
Before we get into all this, let's establish one thing. The point of describing a fight scene - or any action scene - in the
first place is to let the reader envision it. I say 'let' because if you just skip over the scene ("We fought and I came out on
top"), the reader is all but forcefully prevented from envisioning it; if they care enough about the story to be reading it,
they're just going to want to go on. Stopping their reading to imagine a fight would kill the enjoyment of doing so. That's why
this has to be the author's responsibility. With that, here are a few points of advice I can give, despite being clearly not an
expert myself:
</p>

<dt><b>Equal time</b></dt><dd><p>
This isn't a really big mistake unless you take it super far, but try to make sure that time is passing at the same rate for
everyone.
</p><p>
This happens constantly in <a href="/reviews/aot">Attack on Titan</a>. The worst instance was when they're trying to
convince the soldiers that Eren's not a titan: after Eren tells Armin that he has 15 seconds to make his decision, the amount of
conversation between then and when he does couldn't possibly have taken place in less than a minute. It was so bad that I
actually laughed at it.

<dt><b>Realisticity</b></dt><dd><p>
If the images you put in the reader's mind involve obvious physical impossibilities, the effect is ruined and you would've been
better off just summarizing the scene (although still bad off in most cases).
</p><p>
As far as fight scenes in particular, there are three main types as far as I'm concerned: fisticuffs, swordfights, and
gunfights. Each one is very different. And obviously, writing a realistic fight scene is very hard if you don't know much about
the relevant kind of combat in real life. This is problematic insofar as the reader <i>does</i> have the knowledge you lack,
since if they don't they won't know you're being unrealistic. And obviously the burden is alleviated by less detailed
choreography (see below). But only partially.
</p><p>
That's why it's such a good idea in fantasy novels to create a radically new
combat system: no reader will be more qualified on it than you are. No one in real life has any first-hand experience and you've put a lot more thought into the ruleset than anyone else has. Of course, that doesn't completely solve the problem - you still have to follow basic ideas of physics and human intelligence (make sure characters who are supposed to be
experienced fighters don't forget to use an ability or technique that you've taught the reader is a thing in an obviously prime situation for it) - but it's a big help.
</p><p>
Of course, you might argue the real solution is to write less combat-centric stories. I do believe stories without fight scenes
are underdone (certainly underdone by me) and if you've got a good idea for a story that can have meaningful stakes and all
without any fighting, go for it. But to my uncreative mind, this is the obvious way of creating and resolving conflict.
<!--</p><p>
Regarding fisticuffs in particular, I've gained a little bit of experience recently, and if there's one thing I've learned it's this: there needs to be a lot less punching and kicking and dodging and a lot more grappling. Especially if you're fighting for serious injury: you know that a punch to the chest
or a limb might hurt a bit, but it does basically nothing in terms of actually incapacitating your opponent. If that's your characters' goal, and they're not stupid, they should know that the main way to do that without a weapon is trauma to a vulnerable body part, such as the head.
My advice as a near-novice of the art would be to use the environment. Be mindful of nearby tables or other hard objects. Being pushed into one can be a lot more injurious than being punched.-->

<dt><b>Level of choreography</b></dt><dd><p>
I think a pitfall I fell into routinely when I was in my first few years of writing was over-choregraphing. I would describe
every hit and every motion and probably bored the nonexistent readers a lot. If the scene is important, it might be worth
choreographing everything. But if it's too long or you've had similar scenes before, try only showing the turning points; eg. in
a sword fight, describe only the parts where someone takes a wound, perhaps joining them with something like "We fight for
another minute, and then", and remember to show the POV character's change in mood each time.
