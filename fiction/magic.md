TITLE An attempt to define 'magic'
NAV An attempt to define 'magic'

I think the primary defining mark of magic is intimacy. Magic is forces that are some combination of:

* Triggered/controlled by conditions intrinsically meaningful to people rather than scientifically definable. For example, a power gained from having a certain type of experience, or that only works when you're in genuine danger, as opposed to a power gained from an injection or that only works in the dark.

* Not manufacturable

* Reactive directly to the wielder's mental state

* Inseparable from the person who wields them, instead of coming from a detached physical object

Putting it this way makes it more evident why many of us - myself included - are so attracted to the idea. Magical forces feel more personal than technological forces in a number of ways.

In particular I like how it's perfect for natural progression. It's a common theme that the hero gets stronger or more powerful as the story progresses, and when magic is magic instead of technology, this is easy. In the past I've done things like "when you kill someone, you absorb their magic", which feels *right* in a personal progression type of sense.
