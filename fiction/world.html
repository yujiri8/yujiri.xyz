TITLE What makes a good world
NAV Worldbuilding
TEMPLATE DEFAULT

<p>Worldbuilding can be one of the most fun parts of creating a fantasy story. I think part of the reason is because in the worldbuilding phase, your mind is free to imagine all the great potential of your world and all the interesting people that might exist in it, not yet bound by any specific plot.
I claim there are four prime traits that makes a good fantasy (or sci-fi) world.</p>
<!--
<li><p>Think about how the world came to be the way it is.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure the world is stable (or, if it isn't, account for that in your plot). .</p></li>
-->
<dt><b>Believability</b></dt>
<dd><p>One of the biggest challenges when creating a radically different world is to make sure it could actually exist. A prime example of failure is <a href="/reviews/harry_potter">Harry Potter</a>. Rowling introduced a magic system with no apparent cost to use or limits on what it can do, and a society of people who have it, but as far as we can tell, those people
live similarly to muggles. Also, it's totally unrealistic that magic is kept a secret. With mages being so powerful, they could be millionaires if they were only to sell their services to muggles. If the argument is that magic makes your life so good you don't even care about having money, then first of all, that would have a tremendous psychological and spiritual
effect on the people that live that way, second, what about doing magic for others out of altruism, third, what about telling your loved ones the truth simply for the sake for it, and fourth, money can buy more than just pleasure, it gives you power over the muggle world. With so many huge incentives to come clean with muggles, it's quite far-fetched that the ministry of
magic has been able to keep it a secret.</p>
<p>Not every story that fails on world believability does because it doesn't consider the implications of a radical new power it introduces. When you get carried away by how cool your world is it can be easy to just forget to think about the basic necessities of life.
If the world is similar enough to ours then these are usually already solved, but in the case of a radically different world you have to answer questions like, How does your society produce food? What kind of houses do they live in? How do they get around?
What do they do with their waste? If you fail to answer these questions, you're left with the worst possible result: a tower of Jenga blocks falling over because you neglected the base.</p></dd>
<dt><b>Transparency</b></dt>
<dd><p>If you've created a cool world, it's all for nothing if you don't show it to the reader. Stories set in fantasy worlds should generally try to show off the world as much as you can. The challenge is how to do this in a way that doesn't distract from the plot.</p></dd>
<dt><b>Difference</b></dt>
<dd><p>Fantasy worlds are cool because they're different from our world. Our world is boring. Nothing cool happens in our world. (Or, to the extent that it does, we're influenced by "the grass is always greener on the other side" bias.) So all other things the same, the more different a fantasy world is the better. The only reason it doesn't seem that way in practice
is because extreme differences tend to require exposition which can distract from the plot, and also make it hard to maintain...</p></dd>
<dt><b>Relatability</b></dt>
<dd><p>If you make your world too different, you might make it hard for the reader to understand it or the characters who live in it. For example, if the world is 4-dimensional or the people in it are centipedes, what would it even be like to live there? The reader can't appreciate it if they don't know what it's like.</p></dd>
