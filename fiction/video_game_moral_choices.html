MARKDOWN

I like when RPGs give me moral choices. I like it because I hate being railroaded into doing something I don't believe in, even if I know it's pretend. That's actually the reason I dropped Dragon Age: Origins, an otherwise decent game.

Before we go on, I want to explain something. The reason I've never complained about moral railroading in JRPGs is because those games usually don't give you story choices at all and they don't have you make the player character at the start. If the game isn't trying to sell the idea that the player character is "me", then I don't mind being
forced to guide them to do immoral things. I only complain in that case if the rest of the story is [portraying](/fiction/messages) them as unambiguously right. So I'll focus on WRPGs for the rest of this article.

(Before we go on, one more thing. The definitions of "JRPG" and "WRPG" vary so widely depending on who you're talking to that I don't think it's fair to say any definition is "correct". For my purposes, I'm assuming that the difference is that WRPGs have a main character that is supposed to "be" the player, while JRPGs have the player controlling a writer-made character.)

Continuing from the beginning, yes, in general, moral choices in RPGs are a good idea. The way they're generally implemented, though, I have to pick on, because they tend to fall heavily into white and black morality. You'll have two choices: one extreme lawful good and the other extreme chaotic evil, or worse, [strawman chaotic evil](strawman_chaotic_evil).
For example in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II, I was once approached by a beggar who asked for money and my only two options were to give him money or say "get out of here before I kill you" - *no neutral choice*. It was especially frustrating for me because that game was the first time I was trying playing a non-pure good character in an RPG.
I was trying to be sort of chaotic neutral. But no, I could only be Jedi or Sith.

More than just not offering any shades of grey, I think RPG developers are missing the point of moral choices. Doing a simple "good versus evil" polarity system is uninspired and fails to patch the railroading problem with player-inserted story games (which I discussed in the beginning). I understand why they do this. Offering every option a player could argue for in a
complicated moral situation is really expensive, so they want to steer away from controversial issues in their stories to minimize the number of players who feel the way I do. It makes sense as a business decision. But it really hurts their storytelling. Also, it's basically giving yourself an impossible task to write an overall plot that works for both an extreme good and an
extreme evil protagonist.

For an example, I'll look at a common situation from Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. In this game, you frequently wipe out a group of enemies and then someone who was forced into being their chef or something begs you for mercy. You can spare them for light side points or kill them for dark side points. Except that most of your companions are decent people and wouldn't
stick around if you were going to kill innocents. So, in some instances of this sitation, like in the Black Vulkar base, picking the dark side option merely prompts one of your companions to say "wait, this person isn't a threat, we should let them go" and then the person thanks you for your mercy and leaves. Who the hell thought this was a good idea?!? It's incredibly
maddening to dark side players since it not only makes a false promise that they can choose this but then completely shits on their agency as they're forced to submit to their companion, and it *still breaks the believability of your companions* because they still know that you tried to kill an innocent person, so they would still betray you or at least leave if they
were good.

Instead, I argue, game developers should use moral choices to allow players to define their own idea of what counts as "good". Sure, it's expensive as I've admitted, but if you're a AAA studio then you should be able to handle that if you waste less time writing these dumbass false choice situations. You don't have to do anything super complicated. You don't have to explore
situations where dozens of different options are possible. I just wish they'd explore *some* level of ambiguity (Even a simple "do you spare the defeated enemy mook whose actual level of guilt is uncertain?" situation is easy to implement, easy to portray neutrally, and widely applicable),
or at least acknowledge the ambiguity that's already there (by not shoehorning in a judgement on a very two-sided issue, or providing additional options when it's trivial to do so, like in the beggar case above).

Jade Empire tried to do this, by contrasting "the Way of the Open Palm", which is the traditional heroic way of thinking, with "the Way of the Closed Fist", a moral philosophy that is not evil, but says that it is often better to let someone suffer (or even cause them to suffer) so that they learn to solve their own problems and grow stronger from it.
A true, non-strawman follower of the Closed Fist would not give money to beggars and would not do favors for random people around town, but would still risk themselves to take down an evil emperor. I actually would stand by Closed Fist in a few situations (<a href="/protagonism/virtues">virtue of Fecundity</a>). Unfortunately, they completely forgot about the
definition of the Closed Fist philosophy they gave in the beginning and most of the choices designated as Closed Fist are just evil and have nothing to do with the philosophy (eg. you see a lone merchant being mugged by a group of armed thugs and the closed fist choice is to do nothing - what about forcing the thugs to solve their own problems?).
</p><p>
Open Palm versus Closed Fist was a questionable idea for a recurring moral dichotomy in an RPG anyway, since most players will favor Open Palm unilaterally, and since a real Closed Fist follower would probably refuse most RPG quests. But they could have at least avoided strawmanning the Closed Fist side into oblivion in the cases where it does come up.
In the thugs case, how about Closed Fist means killing the thugs and Open Palm means stopping them, but talking to them and finding out that they're poor and unemployed, and then letting them go while only taking their weapons? Or maybe both kill the thugs, but Closed Fist means giving the merchant a weapon once they're defeated and forcing him to do the killing? If he, as is
normal in our culture, has an unreasonably strong aversion to killing, then that is a weakness that he needs to overcome.
