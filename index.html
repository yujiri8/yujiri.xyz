<p><b>January 26:</b>
I added the <a href="software/pythontut2">second part of my Python tutorial</a> and a <a href="argument/shane_utilitarianism">rebuttal to Shane Killian on utilitarianism</a>.
</p>
<p><b>January 25:</b>
Fixed a slight bug where if you loaded the Spem search page with the <code>c</code> query param, like from a recent comments link, it would load the whole dictionary because it would see that you loaded it with some query params, but no filters.
</p><p>
I also posted <a href="software/pythontut1">the first part of my Python tutorial</a>. There are an infinite number of them, I know, but I haven't seen a single one I like, and I really wanted to do it.
</p>
<p><b>January 22:</b>
<i>Tons</i> of new words added to Spem! The word count is over 560 now :) New articles on software: <a href="software/evil">Incomplete list of formats, standards, and technologies that should die</a> and <a href="software/readability">Why readability is important</a>. I also added "rule of law" to <a href="argument/propaganda#rule-of-law">Propaganda words and phrases</a>.
</p>
<p><b>January 21:</b>
I found out <a href="protagonism/circumcision">the most horrifying thing I learned about America in a long time</a>. In happier news, updates to Spem: <spem>verÉªÎ¸</spem> -> <spem>yeÎ¸</spem>, <spem>felÉªÎ¸</spem> -> <spem>weÎ¸</spem>, <spem>vÉ‘rÉªÎ¸</spem> -> <spem>yaÎ¸</spem>, <spem>falÉªÎ¸</spem> -> <spem>waÎ¸</spem>; all the should words have been added to the dictionary; a <a href="spem/rfc">new question added on directness</a>; and a tentative solution accepted to the age old conundrum of "without" I used to describe on the notes of <spem>u</spem>: due to the way Spem entities aggregate by default, "without" as different from "minus" is <spem>i nu</spem>. I also added a neat feature to the Spem dictionary: if you load it with a query string in the URL, it'll be automatically searched for.
</p>
<p><b>January 19:</b>
I finally got around to editing my <a href="protagonism/property">attempt at a complete formulation of the ethics of ownership</a> with what I learned from the folks at r/DebateAnarchism. I haven't edited the article on capitalism yet.
</p>
<p><b>January 16:</b>
Long-term improvement: the page URLs no longer have <code>.html</code>. Requesting the <code>.html</code> version should redirect to the new version.
</p>
<p><b>January 14:</b>
I've changed my philosophy on simplicity in game design a bit after discussion with 231 in the comments. I've edited the articles on <a href="game_design/depth">Depth</a> and <a href="game_design/simplicity">Simplicity</a>.
</p>
<p><b>January 13:</b>
New arguments: <a href="argument/dashes">Oh my god, please stop writing dashes without spaces</a>, <a href="argument/yujiris_first_law">Yujiri's First Law</a> and <a href="argument/yujiris_second_law">Yujiri's Second Law</a>.
</p>
<p><b>January 12:</b>
New articles: <a href="argument/identity_politics">The inherent logical problem with identity politics</a>,
<a href="protagonism/cosmic_slot_machine">The Cosmic Slot Machine actually works...</a>, and
my <a href="software/nginx">Nginx review</a>. I really missed talking about software.
</p><p>
Later today, I fixed the navbar/URL title for the Software category. I originally called it "computing", because I
wanted it to be more general than "programming" etc, but the right name didn't come to mind until the Jan 6
improvements.
</p>
<p><b>January 9:</b>
One small but significant technical improvement: the section id links are less ugly now; they use the standard formula instead of a bare URL-safe encoding of the header text. The reason I didn't do this before was because I had some difficulty figuring out how to use <a href="https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2">Trent's Markdown library</a> for this, so I put it off, but I wanted to get this out of the way before I gain much popularity.
</p>
<p><b>January 8:</b>
Changes to Spem: <spem>kyu</spem> is dead and the relevant proposition has been accepted, resulting in the
addition of an article on <a href="spem/multiple_predicates">multiple predicates</a>.
</p>
<p><b>January 7:</b>
New rebuttal: <a href="argument/first_round_capital">First Round Capital is Sexist</a>.
</p>
<p><b>January 6:</b>
Category images added! I still have a few dissatisfactions with the change, but it looks so much fancier I couldn't
wait to push it out.
</p>
<p><b>January 4:</b>
More substantial updates to Spem, including the shortening of <spem>zÉµrÉªÎ¸</spem> and <spem>selÉªÎ¸</spem> to
<spem>zir</spem> and <spem>sel</spem>, the celebrable death of <spem>zÉªtu</spem>, some improvements to tags,
the official shortening of <spem>yen</spem> to <spem>en</spem>, and the death of <spem>zuni</spem> and the
addition of <a href="spem/rfc">the relevant question</a> to the RFC page.
</p>
<p><b>January 3:</b>
I've got one small general improvement for today: the recent comment links link to the particular comment,
so it's easier to find what's new on pages that have a ton. Unfortunately due to the way fragment scrolling
works and that the comments load after the page, this doesn't scroll all the way down to the comment, but
to the comment section, and I don't have an obvious way to fix that. I imagine the change is still appreciated though.
</p><p>
There's also some pretty cool Spem updates: <spem>Î¸e</spem> and <spem>Î¸i</spem> have been added at long last after
I finally got confident in my understanding of what they mean; <a href="spem/rfc">several more open questions</a>
have been added to the list (<spem>Éªl É‘n ÊŒ Éªn kuto Å‹e ki tiku Éªn tetÉªk ne mi</spem>), and that's right -
<spem>Å‹el</spem> finally became <spem>Å‹e</spem> :) Feels like shattering a sentimental antique. That word's
been <spem>Å‹el</spem> for ages. It was one of the first words I added to Spem, since "of" was one of the first
English conflation demons I tried to tackle. That was way back in the days of Odyssey Of The Elements.
</p>
<p><b>January 2:</b>
New articles: <a href="argument/hypocritical_objectivism">Hypocritical Objectivism</a> and
<a href="argument/socialism_not_greedy">Socialism Is Not Greedy</a>.
</p>
<p><b>January 1:</b>
New article: <a href="protagonism/legislation_enforcement">The separation of legislation and enforcement
is harmful</a>.
</p>
<p><b>December 31:</b>
<ul>
<li><p>
	On <a href="spem/search">the Spem dictionary page</a>, notes search by regex is finally available.
</p></li><li><p>
	<a href="spem/transliteration">The Spem ASCII transliteration scheme</a> has been defined.
</p></li><li><p>
	A minor improvement to the Markdown system: fenced code blocks no longer put the &lt;code&gt; inside of the
	&lt;pre&gt; (which made the &lt;code&gt; styling apply only to the text and not the whole block).
</p></li><li><p>
	The big one: <b>We got header links now!</b> Check 'em out. Let me know if you find any that don't work.
</p></li><li><p>
	New page with <a href="spem/rfc">Spem open questions</a>. I plan to start using that page as a general
	page to keep track of everything I'm looking for input on, but I'm not merging the page about variable
	derefencing into there yet.
</p></li><li><p>
	The old articles on the problems with "harm", "self-defense", and "extremism" have been merged into a new
	article on <a href="argument/propaganda">Propaganda words and phrases</a> that includes all of them
	and some more.
</p></li><li><p>
	New argument: <a href="argument/ethical_notions_personhood">Rebuttal to Insula Qui's
	"The Ethical Notions of Personhood and Savagery"</a>.
</p></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>December 30:</b>
I've been making some changes to the Spem articles. In particular <a href="spem/types">the tradeoffs of
parts of speech</a> and <a href="spem/defaults">default identifiers</a> have been edited.
</p>
<p><b>December 22:</b>
I'd decided to redo my article on the status of children in society, to expand it a lot and divide the topics I covered
into three separate articles, of which I've just finished two, and three other new articles. There's now <a href="protagonism/children">Children are not property</a>, <a href="protagonism/sheltering_children">Sheltering children is harmful</a>, and <a href="protagonism/children_immature">Children aren't as immature as you think...</a>, <a href="protagonism/stockholm_syndrome">Stockholm syndrome is human nature</a>, and <a href="protagonism/statist_stockholm">All statists have Stockholm syndrome</a>.
</p><p>
I really need to decide on a capitalization convention for article names. My inconsistency is painful.
</p>
<p><b>December 21:</b>
New article, and my first rebuttal to a Youtube video:
<a href="argument/the_origin_of_consciousness">The origin of consciousness</a>.
</p>
<p><b>December 20:</b>
Woohoo! <a href="works/return_to_the_portrait/">RTTP</a> Part 2 is out!
</p>
<p><b>December 19:</b>
I've implemented comment subtree viewing! I know that ideally it should do this without reloading the page, but
I'll stop here for now.
</p><p>
I'm trying to delete my old (bad) liberty.me account to start anew, but unfortunately I can't because I don't have
access to the old email address anymore, and I can't change it because Wordpress sends a confirmation email to do that...
to the new address... but apparently they have mail routing issues and closed the support thread where a dozen people
reported it a year ago without resolution :/
</p>
<p><b>December 18:</b>
Update to Spem articles <a href="spem/linking">Linking clauses</a> and <a href="spem/should">should</a>.
Some important new words added also (mi jini yam kor Î¸É‘r), <s>incl</s> keÎ¸Éªs 'yÉ‘ri' (i yo), 'vien', 'dimu', i tir
yÉªÅ‹ Éªl verbs Å‹el ki kei; i jinu kazu i kanu - tem ÊŒ zu.
I've also done some more under-the-hood improvements: I added the &lt;input-list&gt; element, and it can work
with &lt;select&gt;s too. So I've got my Spem admin interface back. Finally, I added an article I started
drafting a while ago: <a href="protagonism/consent">The loss of the concept of Consent</a>.
</p>
<p><b>December 17:</b>
I finally completed the Lit-Element move! Phew, this took most of 4 days. I probably put almost 30 hours into it.
But it's done! Noticeable improvements:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
	The authentication popup is way better! No more HTTP Basic auth; I use the mwc-dialog element, so the field
	asking for your email doesn't have to be labeled "username" anymore.
</p></li><li><p>
	Relatedly, you'll see an area in the top-left when you're logged in showing who as and giving a link to
	the notification settings page.
</p></li><li><p>
	A minor aesthetic change: I've added a slight box-shadow around comments. Let me know what you think of it.
</p></li><li><p>
	Most important of all: I've added an email entry field to the comment element, so you don't have to make
	an account separately. When you use this field, your account is automatically created and subscribed to
	the one comment. I didn't want to do that without confirmation before, but I realized that a spammer can
	already spam you with confirmation emails, so it doesn't really make anything worse if they can subscribe
	you to a single comment, as long as they can't mess with your settings once you've got your account.
	Finally, entering the email address (which is auto-filled by a cookie) on the comment
	submit form auto-subscribes you to it, so you won't have to login and click subscribe on all your comments.
	</p><p>
	This was the biggest blocker to my publicity pushes. I didn't want to go for traffic when I had a flaw
	that I thought would cause most commenters to never come back. Once I'm sure everything's working,
	I think it's time to start a liberty.me account and go debate either Eso or Filthy...
</p></li><li><p>
	Instead of having different paragraph elements for errors to show up and me having to worry about targeting
	the right one and clearing it when the request succeeds, I use
	<a href="https://github.com/Victor-Bernabe/lit-toast">lit-toast</a> to show error and success messages.
</p></li><li><p>
	I've enabled gzip, which will mitigate the performance loss. It reduces the size of the Javascript
	bundle from about 115 KB to 35 KB.
</p></li><li><p>
	main_gi found another XSS vulnerability, although less severe. My markdown processor escapes HTML first but
	doesn't stop bookmarklet links generated from Markdown. This should be fixed.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
I've also improved my tmpl.py script on the backend, and merged an old repo that didn't have anything else I was
still using into the main one. And the navbar path is computed by the frontend now, rather than stored during
templating.
</p><p>
And finally, there've been some more mundane updates. I've improved <a href="protagonism/power">Power Doesn't
Corrupt You, Idiot</a> and significantly edited my critiques of <a href="reviews/lotr">Lord of the Rings</a> and
<a href="reviews/mass_effect">Mass Effect</a>.
</p>
<p><b>December 15:</b>
It's been a while since I posted normal articles, but today I've got two:
<a href="argument/relativism_not_inconsistent">Relativism Is Not Inconsistent</a> and
<a href="argument/condescending_conservative">The Condescending Fake Intellectualism of Conservatives</a>.
</p><p>
The Web Components move is coming. Today and yesterday I got a break from my job and managed to get a lot of
progress on it. The site will look fancier, have a better authentication popup with non-misleading labels,
and if all goes according to plan it'll land at the same time as the last major interface change I want to make
before I start pushing for publicity.
</p><p>
RTTP is also coming! The script is completed, it just needs testing/debugging and some editing.
</p>
<p><b>December 11:</b>
No content update, but I looked into the Web Components thing a bit and found out the build didn't have to
be that big. I had it set to build for development, which made it way bigger. I've done some more exploring of
Web Component building systems and I've found at least two promising options, so I'm back to being fairly sure
I'll do the move. Just gotta do some more investigation to find out what the best solution is and then set
aside a day for it.
</p>
<p><b>December 8:</b>
I got banned from r/ShitStatistsSay for pointing out a double standard that holds children to have less rights than
adults, and had a hilarious exchange with the moderators about it. I added details and screenshots to
<a href="protagonism/age_of_consent">the relevant Protagonism article</a>.
</p>
<p><b>December 7:</b>
I spent a few hours tonight looking into my ambition to migrate to Lit-Element, but this time, I'm starting to think
the dream is just a bust. I found a compiler solution using Webpack that only required me to install the one package
(no Babel needed!)... with its >300 dependencies, of course. I actually started making components, but then I looked
at the bundle.js being generated even with only using the one small library and two MWC components to make the
theme switch better, and for some goddamn reason it was 14,000 lines. And that's without the sourcemap, without which
I can't reasonably debug. So I decided you know what, that's not even worth it. Screw web components. Screw
<code>npm</code> forever. I continued in the good old primitive ways and added the ability for me to delete comments
from the web interface.
</p><p>
I'm also starting to hate Django more, since I found out today that apparently it swallows uncaught exceptions
unless I specifically catch them and <code>traceback.print_exc()</code>. I didn't think it used to do that. Its
admin interface is borderline useless since I can't filter or search objects at all, and today I found out it won't
accept me creating an object if I don't put non-empty values in certain fields that don't have a non-empty constraint
(doing it from <code>psql</code> worked). But the database management is still so valuable...
</p>
<p><b>December 4:</b>
Today I <a href="reviews/jedi_fallen_order">finished and reviewed Jedi: Fallen Order</a>,
and posted a new Spem conlang article: <a href="spem/profiles">The phonetic mapping</a>, and
<a href="argument/learning_language">Languages are not easier to learn as a kid</a>.
</p><p>
Sigh... lastly, I've been reminded that I somehow forgot to note the addition of
<a href="https://yujiri.xyz/spem/dereference">Spem conlang open question: variable dereferencing?</a>.
</p>
<p><b>December 3:</b>
I updated my article on the <a href="/argument/what_if_everyone">"What If Everyone" fallacy</a> to add an example
I encountered today. It was too gold to pass up.
</p>
<p><b>November 29:</b>
I made a performance improvement: the server sends with each comment whether it has replies, so the browser
doesn't have to make an extra request for each comment it loads that doesn't have replies.
</p>
<p><b>November 27:</b>
On the <a href="spem/search">Spem search page</a>, you can now enter multiple space-separated words to display
them all. Thanks to main_gi for the great suggestion :)
</p>
<p><b>November 24:</b>
I changed how I do markdown processing so blockquotes in comments work now.
</p>
<p><b>November 22:</b>
New article: <a href="argument/fee_bystander">Yes, Tyler Curtis, The Bystander Effect Exists</a>.
</p>
<p><b>November 21:</b>
New Spem post: <a href="spem/defaults">Open question: Default identifiers</a>. Input appreciated!
</p>
<p><b>November 16:</b>
New article: <a href="argument/changing_language">Trying to change a living language</a>.
</p>
<p><b>November 15:</b>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="protagonism/bystander">The Bystander Effect - a story of my failure</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="protagonism/self_defense">The problem with the term "self-defense"</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="argument/noncompetitive">The Noncompetitive Fallacy</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="argument/same_person">Not the same person?</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="protagonism/market">The free market in a nutshell</a>. I've been working on this article
for a long time. Since I think most conservatives already know the "drill" on the free market, I tried to
tailor it to people who were raised with a liberal conception of economics and just haven't really questioned it yet.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="protagonism/anarchist_memes">Anarchist meme dump.</a></p></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>November 14:</b>
New Spem article: <a href="spem/questions">Questions</a>. I'm still undecided on some aspects but
I'm posting my thoughts. I've also added some content to the article on <a href="spem/should">Should</a>,
and my <a href="reviews/ff13">retrospective of Final Fantasy 13's story</a>.
I'm glad I finally got this done. Also <a href="argument/history_philosophy">There is no history of philosophy</a>,
and <a href="argument/national_debt">There's no such thing as national debt</a>.
</p>
<p><b>November 13:</b>
New <a href="spem/objects">Spem conlang quickie: Verb objects</a>. Also tons of new words. We're almost at
400 now :)
</p><p>
Something I'm considering is that opposites should always be sorted next to each other in search results. I could
add a foreign key Opposite on the Word model that would enable that, but it would be a bit difficult to make it
actually sort that way. Probably incur a performance hit. It'd also be a ton of work for me to go through all the
words manually and tag their opposites, which I'd have to do. But if it's going to happen, better now than later.
I'm just not sure if it is. I might need a different solution for sorting anyway. I don't like the "last modified
at the top" sort I have now - it's good for seeing new stuff but I'd like to have an option to sort in a more
reasonable way, like by advancement somehow.
</p>
<p><b>November 12:</b>
New <a href="spem/should">Spem conlang quickie: Should</a>. It could use some feedback. I also added
the voiced th to <a href="spem/alphabet">the alphabet</a>. I don't like that sound and didn't want to
use it, but last night I realized there are going to need to be a <i>lot</i> of nouns, and the extra letter
will help a lot.
</p>
<p><b>November 11:</b>
Dark mode switch added, as well as tons of <a href="spem/search">progress on Spem</a> and the button
to hide this log (I figured it'd be useful on mobile).
</p>
<p><b>November 10:</b>
I added the ability to set passwords for notification management.
</p>
<p><b>November 9:</b>
<h1>Notifications are here!</h1>
<p>
I haven't been this excited in a long time. I added the ability to opt-in to email notifications on comment replies!
You enter your address and follow the link in the confirmation email to give your browser an auth cookie that lets
you edit your subscription settings. There's still a lot I need to do, like schedule email sending in the background
so posting a comment isn't delayed by it, allowing setting a username for your address so your comments can be
authenticated, a way to view a subtree of the comments, and a bunch more, but I've been at this all day so I'm
takin' a break.
</p><p>
Part of the reason I'm so excited is that not having this was one of the main things holding me back from going
for publicity. I didn't want to make any big pushes if people might come here and leave a comment and then forget
about it. In a few more days, when this feature is more polished, it might be time to go to the Backalley discord
and start spreading the word about Spem, make a liberty.me account where I mostly just mirror my anarchism-related
articles, maybe debate Eso on metaphysics...

There's also a new article: <a href="software/fighting_over_keyboard">Fighting over the keyboard</a>.
</p><p>
I cleared two months of old update history, because recently I noticed how much scrolling that meant for mobile
users to see the comments. Probably should have a button to hide the update log or something.

<p><b>November 8:</b>
Two new articles: <a href="argument/worrying">Worrying is not irrational</a> and
<a href="argument/disputed_premise">Disputed premise, not circular reasoning</a>. I also revised my explanations
of <a href="protagonism/metaphysics">why it's impossible to rationally believe that consciousness
is a product of matter</a> and <a href="protagonism/sleep">how sleep works</a>.
</p>
<p><b>November 7:</b>
Four new articles: <a href="protagonism/personal_determinism">Societal diagnosis: personal determinism</a>;
<a href="protagonism/voting_consent">"Representation" - the worst argument for the legitimacy of government?</a>;
<a href="software/nano">Nano Is A Good Editor</a>; and <a href="fiction/magic">What is 'magic'? An
attempted answer</a>.
</p>
<p><b>November 6:</b>
There have been tons of <a href="spem/search">new words added to Spem</a> lately, including an expansion to
<a href="spem/demonstratives">the demonstratives</a>. I also added my <a href="software/fish">review of the
Fish shell</a>.
</p>
<p><b>November 4:</b>
New article: <a href="protagonism/anarchism_history">ThErE aRe No HiStOrIcAl ExAmPlEs Of AnArChY</a>
</p>
<p><b>November 2:</b>
Well! After so much indecision I finally went ahead and migrated the backend to Django.
We'll see how this goes. The comments and Spem dictionary shouldn't be messed up,
but if they are that's why. The old version of the site is available at
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://old.yujiri.xyz">old.yujiri.xyz</a>, so if the comments are broken, you could comment there
to get my attention.
</p>
<p><b>November 1:</b>
New Spem articles: <a href="spem/quantifiers">Quickie: quantifier-type compounds</a>, and
<a href="spem/verbs_adjectives">Language design insight: the difference between verbs and adjectives</a>.
New pseudo-Protagonism article: <a href="protagonism/apostasy">How I left Catholicism</a>.
