I added the article <a href="misc/masks">Wearing many masks</a>. It's not linked from any categories yet because I'm teetering on the decision of adding a "Misc" category. If I linked this from the root page, I'd have three image-card links that were just to a single article and had the logo as their image. I want to add a Misc category to put this contact info, and the logo explained under, but I'm not quite certain if I want to do that. Having the contact info be two clicks away from the root page is not an idea I'm attracted to...
</p><p>
I've also become sure that the site needs a more serious interface revamp, which might affect how I want to do this. The navbar is too cluttered on narrow viewports on a subcategory page. I'm pretty sure I want to keep the sticky navbar since it has the login status the dark mode switch, and the timestamp is also important to be able to see while reading comments. One thing I'm thinking about is taking out the article title, and displaying it in an &lt;h1&gt; at the top of the article.
</p><p>
I don't like the way it would look, but that idea might have SEO benefits. Now that I'm using the &lt;article&gt; tag and crossposting, I've getting the impression that the article title shouldn't be outside of that element.
</p><p>
An obstacle is that if I used h1's for the article title, I probably couldn't use h1s in the body. I might have to use h2 as a max. That'd require reworking my software reviews. Maybe I could just use h2-h4 and have my stylesheet reduce the different in sizes, so an h4 is still bigger than normal text.
</p><p>
Another thing I've been thinking about is whether it would be a good idea to reduce the pgae width on fullsize screens and use the margin space for a recent comments panel. A lot of other sites show their recent comments panel on all pages. I'd been deterred from doing it here because of the category dissonance - someone might follow a link to a page in one category, and I might look like a link spammer if the first thing they see is comments on unrelated content. But it wouldn't be too difficult to make them scoped to just the category they're on.
</p><p>
Later today, I basically finished <a href="software/pythontut4">The Concise Python Tutorial part 4: Mutable types</a>, but I haven't crossposted it to dev.to yet, as I think it could use some polishing/feedback.
</p>
<p><b>March 2:</b>
New article: <a href="argument/punishment_reward">Punishment and reward are not alternatives</a>.
</p>
<p><b>March 1:</b>
New articles: <a href="protagonism/lying_tradition">Traditions of lying: Santa Claus and April Fools</a> and <a href="software/caching">I hate caching</a>.
</p>
<p><b>February 29:</b>
New articles: <a href="software/kill_software">Kill software for great glory</a> and <a href="software/tags">Tag systems and the problem of variant tags</a>, added PHP to <a href="software/evil">Incomplete list of standards, formats, and technologies that should die</a>, and a new (kinda?) poem: <a href="works/poems/henry_the_hero">Henry The Hero</a>.
</p><p>
I really wanted to write more poems. I have a few scraps I've been thinking about for longer than this one, but when I decided to work on it just flowed. I'm not sure about including the title in the page body like I did for the other two. It seems unnecessary when it's in the navbar, and especially awkward when it's also the first three words in the poem.
</p>
<p><b>February 28:</b>
I've edited my <a href="software/javascript">Javascript review</a>. I've gained a lot of knowledge since I first posted it, and I've added and removed a few points. Also added <a href="software/tests">Change my mind: tests are overrated</a>.
</p>
<p><b>February 26:</b>
New article on software: <a href="software/overempowering_js">Overempowering Javascript</a>.

Some changes to Spem: <spem>yeli</spem> (on purpose) and <spem>vigi</spem> ('work' as in 'succeed') were merged into <spem>zÉªl</spem>, <spem>fel</spem> renamed to <spem>wÉªl</spem>, and <spem>yelu</spem> (on accident) and <spem>fugi</spem> (malfunction) merged into a new word <spem>bÉªl</spem>. I also removed <spem>kÉªtzu</spem>, since it seemed to mean <spem>ki ve</spem>.
</p>
<p><b>February 21:</b>
Two new articles on software: <a href="software/why_root">Why I live as root</a> and <a href="software/safety_choice">Stop trying to take the user's choice</a>.
</p>
<p><b>February 20:</b>
Added the load more button on recent comments. Enjoy, <spem>miki mi</spem>.
</p>
<p><b>February 14:</b>
New article on storytelling (man, how long has it been?): <a href="fiction/chaos_law">The D&D alignment system is worthless</a>.
</p>
<p><b>February 10:</b>
Over the last couple days, I've revised most of my articles on storytelling. All of them dated back to when I was a nascent philosopher with ideas I cringe at now, as well as a much worse writer, and I think they're all in a presentable state now. I actually scrapped the articles on heroes, villains, and worldbuilding, because my whole framework for those ideas was wrong-headed, and I think I said next to nothing I still stand by in them. The only worthwhile stuff I said in the plot article is on its own now: <a href="fiction/pov_lying">Don't have POV characters lie to the audience</a>.
</p><p>
I've also been revising my reviews. The early versions of a lot of them sounded more like a rant to remind myself why I hated the work than an earnest attempt to make the case for someone who wasn't already convinced.
</p>
<p><b>February 7:</b>
Added comment previewing. Enjoy :)
</p>
<p><b>February 6:</b>
I haven't posted in a long time, but today I bring some Spem updates. Added <spem>iv</spem>, <spem>eiv</spem>, <spem>tazi</spem>, and <spem>tafu</spem>, and renamed the combo verb tag to adverb.
</p>
<p><b>January 31:</b>
I posted <a href="software/pythontut3">part 3 of The Concise Python Tutorial</a>.
</p>
<p><b>January 26:</b>
I added the <a href="software/pythontut2">second part of my Python tutorial</a> and a <a href="argument/shane_utilitarianism">rebuttal to Shane Killian on utilitarianism</a>.
</p>
<p><b>January 25:</b>
Fixed a slight bug where if you loaded the Spem search page with the <code>c</code> query param, like from a recent comments link, it would load the whole dictionary because it would see that you loaded it with some query params, but no filters.
</p><p>
I also posted <a href="software/pythontut1">the first part of my Python tutorial</a>. There are an infinite number of them, I know, but I haven't seen a single one I like, and I really wanted to do it.
</p>
<p><b>January 22:</b>
<i>Tons</i> of new words added to Spem! The word count is over 560 now :) New articles on software: <a href="software/evil">Incomplete list of formats, standards, and technologies that should die</a> and <a href="software/readability">Why readability is important</a>. I also added "rule of law" to <a href="argument/propaganda#rule-of-law">Propaganda words and phrases</a>.
</p>
<p><b>January 21:</b>
I found out <a href="protagonism/circumcision">the most horrifying thing I learned about America in a long time</a>. In happier news, updates to Spem: <spem>verÉªÎ¸</spem> -> <spem>yeÎ¸</spem>, <spem>felÉªÎ¸</spem> -> <spem>weÎ¸</spem>, <spem>vÉ‘rÉªÎ¸</spem> -> <spem>yaÎ¸</spem>, <spem>falÉªÎ¸</spem> -> <spem>waÎ¸</spem>; all the should words have been added to the dictionary; a <a href="spem/rfc">new question added on directness</a>; and a tentative solution accepted to the age old conundrum of "without" I used to describe on the notes of <spem>u</spem>: due to the way Spem entities aggregate by default, "without" as different from "minus" is <spem>i nu</spem>. I also added a neat feature to the Spem dictionary: if you load it with a query string in the URL, it'll be automatically searched for.
</p>
<p><b>January 19:</b>
I finally got around to editing my <a href="protagonism/property">attempt at a complete formulation of the ethics of ownership</a> with what I learned from the folks at r/DebateAnarchism. I haven't edited the article on capitalism yet.
</p>
<p><b>January 16:</b>
Long-term improvement: the page URLs no longer have <code>.html</code>. Requesting the <code>.html</code> version should redirect to the new version.
</p>
<p><b>January 14:</b>
I've changed my philosophy on simplicity in game design a bit after discussion with 231 in the comments. I've edited the articles on <a href="game_design/depth">Depth</a> and <a href="game_design/simplicity">Simplicity</a>.
</p>
<p><b>January 13:</b>
New arguments: <a href="argument/dashes">Oh my god, please stop writing dashes without spaces</a>, <a href="argument/yujiris_first_law">Yujiri's First Law</a> and <a href="argument/yujiris_second_law">Yujiri's Second Law</a>.
</p>
<p><b>January 12:</b>
New articles: <a href="argument/identity_politics">The inherent logical problem with identity politics</a>,
<a href="protagonism/cosmic_slot_machine">The Cosmic Slot Machine actually works...</a>, and
my <a href="software/nginx">Nginx review</a>. I really missed talking about software.
</p><p>
Later today, I fixed the navbar/URL title for the Software category. I originally called it "computing", because I
wanted it to be more general than "programming" etc, but the right name didn't come to mind until the Jan 6
improvements.
</p>
<p><b>January 9:</b>
One small but significant technical improvement: the section id links are less ugly now; they use the standard formula instead of a bare URL-safe encoding of the header text. The reason I didn't do this before was because I had some difficulty figuring out how to use <a href="https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2">Trent's Markdown library</a> for this, so I put it off, but I wanted to get this out of the way before I gain much popularity.
</p>
<p><b>January 8:</b>
Changes to Spem: <spem>kyu</spem> is dead and the relevant proposition has been accepted, resulting in the
addition of an article on <a href="spem/multiple_predicates">multiple predicates</a>.
</p>
<p><b>January 7:</b>
New rebuttal: <a href="argument/first_round_capital">First Round Capital is Sexist</a>.
</p>
<p><b>January 6:</b>
Category images added! I still have a few dissatisfactions with the change, but it looks so much fancier I couldn't
wait to push it out.
</p>
<p><b>January 4:</b>
More substantial updates to Spem, including the shortening of <spem>zÉµrÉªÎ¸</spem> and <spem>selÉªÎ¸</spem> to
<spem>zir</spem> and <spem>sel</spem>, the celebrable death of <spem>zÉªtu</spem>, some improvements to tags,
the official shortening of <spem>yen</spem> to <spem>en</spem>, and the death of <spem>zuni</spem> and the
addition of <a href="spem/rfc">the relevant question</a> to the RFC page.
</p>
<p><b>January 3:</b>
I've got one small general improvement for today: the recent comment links link to the particular comment,
so it's easier to find what's new on pages that have a ton. Unfortunately due to the way fragment scrolling
works and that the comments load after the page, this doesn't scroll all the way down to the comment, but
to the comment section, and I don't have an obvious way to fix that. I imagine the change is still appreciated though.
</p><p>
There's also some pretty cool Spem updates: <spem>Î¸e</spem> and <spem>Î¸i</spem> have been added at long last after
I finally got confident in my understanding of what they mean; <a href="spem/rfc">several more open questions</a>
have been added to the list (<spem>Éªl É‘n ÊŒ Éªn kuto Å‹e ki tiku Éªn tetÉªk ne mi</spem>), and that's right -
<spem>Å‹el</spem> finally became <spem>Å‹e</spem> :) Feels like shattering a sentimental antique. That word's
been <spem>Å‹el</spem> for ages. It was one of the first words I added to Spem, since "of" was one of the first
English conflation demons I tried to tackle. That was way back in the days of Odyssey Of The Elements.

</p>
<p><b>December 22:</b>
I'd decided to redo my article on the status of children in society, to expand it a lot and divide the topics I covered
into three separate articles, of which I've just finished two, and three other new articles.

I really need to decide on a capitalization convention for article names. My inconsistency is painful.

<p><b>December 21:</b>
New article, and my first rebuttal to a Youtube video:
<a href="argument/the_origin_of_consciousness">The origin of consciousness</a>.
</p>
<p><b>December 20:</b>
Woohoo! <a href="works/return_to_the_portrait/">RTTP</a> Part 2 is out!
</p>
<p><b>December 19:</b>
I've implemented comment subtree viewing! I know that ideally it should do this without reloading the page, but
I'll stop here for now.
</p><p>
I'm trying to delete my old (bad) liberty.me account to start anew, but unfortunately I can't because I don't have
access to the old email address anymore, and I can't change it because Wordpress sends a confirmation email to do that...
to the new address... but apparently they have mail routing issues and closed the support thread where a dozen people
reported it a year ago without resolution :/
</p>
<p><b>December 18:</b>
Update to Spem articles <a href="spem/linking">Linking clauses</a> and <a href="spem/should">should</a>.
Some important new words added also (mi jini yam kor Î¸É‘r), <s>incl</s> keÎ¸Éªs 'yÉ‘ri' (i yo), 'vien', 'dimu', i tir
yÉªÅ‹ Éªl verbs Å‹el ki kei; i jinu kazu i kanu - tem ÊŒ zu.
I've also done some more under-the-hood improvements: I added the &lt;input-list&gt; element, and it can work
with &lt;select&gt;s too. So I've got my Spem admin interface back. Finally, I added an article I started
drafting a while ago: <a href="protagonism/consent">The loss of the concept of Consent</a>.
</p>
<p><b>December 17:</b>
I finally completed the Lit-Element move! Phew, this took most of 4 days. I probably put almost 30 hours into it.
But it's done! Noticeable improvements:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
	The authentication popup is way better! No more HTTP Basic auth; I use the mwc-dialog element, so the field
	asking for your email doesn't have to be labeled "username" anymore.
</p></li><li><p>
	Relatedly, you'll see an area in the top-left when you're logged in showing who as and giving a link to
	the notification settings page.
</p></li><li><p>
	A minor aesthetic change: I've added a slight box-shadow around comments. Let me know what you think of it.
</p></li><li><p>
	Most important of all: I've added an email entry field to the comment element, so you don't have to make
	an account separately. When you use this field, your account is automatically created and subscribed to
	the one comment. I didn't want to do that without confirmation before, but I realized that a spammer can
	already spam you with confirmation emails, so it doesn't really make anything worse if they can subscribe
	you to a single comment, as long as they can't mess with your settings once you've got your account.
	Finally, entering the email address (which is auto-filled by a cookie) on the comment
	submit form auto-subscribes you to it, so you won't have to login and click subscribe on all your comments.
	</p><p>
	This was the biggest blocker to my publicity pushes. I didn't want to go for traffic when I had a flaw
	that I thought would cause most commenters to never come back. Once I'm sure everything's working,
	I think it's time to start a liberty.me account and go debate either Eso or Filthy...
</p></li><li><p>
	Instead of having different paragraph elements for errors to show up and me having to worry about targeting
	the right one and clearing it when the request succeeds, I use
	<a href="https://github.com/Victor-Bernabe/lit-toast">lit-toast</a> to show error and success messages.
</p></li><li><p>
	I've enabled gzip, which will mitigate the performance loss. It reduces the size of the Javascript
	bundle from about 115 KB to 35 KB.
</p></li><li><p>
	main_gi found another XSS vulnerability, although less severe. My markdown processor escapes HTML first but
	doesn't stop bookmarklet links generated from Markdown. This should be fixed.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
I've also improved my tmpl.py script on the backend, and merged an old repo that didn't have anything else I was
still using into the main one. And the navbar path is computed by the frontend now, rather than stored during
templating.
</p><p>
And finally, there've been some more mundane updates. I've improved <a href="protagonism/power">Power Doesn't
Corrupt You, Idiot</a> and significantly edited my critiques of <a href="reviews/lotr">Lord of the Rings</a> and
<a href="reviews/mass_effect">Mass Effect</a>.
</p>
<p><b>December 15:</b>
It's been a while since I posted normal articles, but today I've got two:
<a href="argument/relativism_not_inconsistent">Relativism Is Not Inconsistent</a> and
<a href="argument/condescending_conservative">The Condescending Fake Intellectualism of Conservatives</a>.
</p><p>
The Web Components move is coming. Today and yesterday I got a break from my job and managed to get a lot of
progress on it. The site will look fancier, have a better authentication popup with non-misleading labels,
and if all goes according to plan it'll land at the same time as the last major interface change I want to make
before I start pushing for publicity.
</p><p>
RTTP is also coming! The script is completed, it just needs testing/debugging and some editing.
</p>
<p><b>December 11:</b>
No content update, but I looked into the Web Components thing a bit and found out the build didn't have to
be that big. I had it set to build for development, which made it way bigger. I've done some more exploring of
Web Component building systems and I've found at least two promising options, so I'm back to being fairly sure
I'll do the move. Just gotta do some more investigation to find out what the best solution is and then set
aside a day for it.
</p>
<p><b>December 8:</b>
I got banned from r/ShitStatistsSay for pointing out a double standard that holds children to have less rights than
adults, and had a hilarious exchange with the moderators about it. I added details and screenshots to
<a href="protagonism/age_of_consent">the relevant Protagonism article</a>.
</p>
<p><b>December 7:</b>
I spent a few hours tonight looking into my ambition to migrate to Lit-Element, but this time, I'm starting to think
the dream is just a bust. I found a compiler solution using Webpack that only required me to install the one package
(no Babel needed!)... with its >300 dependencies, of course. I actually started making components, but then I looked
at the bundle.js being generated even with only using the one small library and two MWC components to make the
theme switch better, and for some goddamn reason it was 14,000 lines. And that's without the sourcemap, without which
I can't reasonably debug. So I decided you know what, that's not even worth it. Screw web components. Screw
<code>npm</code> forever. I continued in the good old primitive ways and added the ability for me to delete comments
from the web interface.

I'm also starting to hate Django more, since I found out today that apparently it swallows uncaught exceptions
unless I specifically catch them and <code>traceback.print_exc()</code>. I didn't think it used to do that. Its
admin interface is borderline useless since I can't filter or search objects at all, and today I found out it won't
accept me creating an object if I don't put non-empty values in certain fields that don't have a non-empty constraint
(doing it from <code>psql</code> worked). But the database management is still so valuable...

<p><b>December 4:</b>
Today I <a href="reviews/jedi_fallen_order">finished and reviewed Jedi: Fallen Order</a>,
and posted a new Spem conlang article: <a href="spem/profiles">The phonetic mapping</a>, and
<a href="argument/learning_language">Languages are not easier to learn as a kid</a>.
</p><p>
Sigh... lastly, I've been reminded that I somehow forgot to note the addition of
<a href="https://yujiri.xyz/spem/dereference">Spem conlang open question: variable dereferencing?</a>.

<p><b>December 3:</b>
I updated my article on the <a href="/argument/what_if_everyone">"What If Everyone" fallacy</a> to add an example
I encountered today. It was too gold to pass up.
