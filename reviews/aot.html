<p>
Attack on Titan (or, as its Japanese name actually means, "Advancing Giants") is an anime with the premise that 100 years ago, a pseudo-medieval human race was beset by the "Titans": enormous human bodies with the intelligence you'd expect from a slime in a
fantasy RPG, but incredible strength, rapid healing of any wounds, and an insatiable hunger for human blood. Unable to win the war, the humans managed to construct three massive walls and retreat behind them. Now, after 100 years, a unique titan appears and
breaks a hole in the outermost wall. The human soldiers are armed with special maneuvering gear that allows them to essentially fly in a Spider Man-like manner, swords, and the knowledge of an extremely precise weakpoint on the Titan's body that allows you to
actually kill it.

The show has a strong protagonist, very strong emotional impact, and a good soundtrack, but I can't recommend it, due to the following criticisms:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
	<p>
	The outrageous misandry in the first two episodes. In episode 1, the protagonist Eren commits an act of minor violence against an asshole that was probably slightly wrong but reasonable given the circumstances, and his adopted sister Mikasa drags him away and throws him into a wall for it. It's bad enough that he's completely helpless as she drags him down an entire alley (they're the same age!), but then he
	doesn't even retaliate, or even seem very angry at her for what was clearly an act of unprovoked violence. This is not just egregious sexism, it's abysmal writing because it's out of character for both of them. Mikasa is supposed to be calm, reserved, and
	protective toward Eren, not physically abusive. Eren, on the other hand, is a pugnacious, reckless boy who demonstrates several times early on in the series that he is anything but the type of "polite" boomerang bigot who wouldn't hit a girl back if she
	hit him first.
	</p><p>
	It gets even worse in the next episode. Here Eren is yelling at Armin for despairing, and Mikasa punches him in the head. He falls over and cries. Then she force feeds him the bread Armin got for them that he said he wouldn't eat because other people
	needed it more. And this is portrayed as acceptable! Nobody would have tolerated either of these scenes if they had been a male character lashing out in violence against a female character, especially not the second one.
	</p><p>
	I read some more in the manga after I finished season 1 (the anime was just the first season back then), and it seems like the misandry picks back up after a while (a scene where Mikasa won't even let Eren help carry things because he "might get tired").
	That was what finally led me to drop it. And sure, you could argue Mikasa was obviously making a joke, but that's completely out of character for her, and besides, it was obvious it was really offending Eren.
	</p>
</li><li>
	<p>
	Eren is the most severely under-<a href="/writing/glory">glorified</a> character I've ever seen. It's just awful.
	He's an outright male damsel in distresss. When he isn't captured (which I'd estimate to be half the source material
	consumption time), he's either losing a fight, doing nothing, or using his unique power that no one else has and that
	has nothing to do with the five years he spent in training. (The power is <span class="spoiler">to turn into a titan
	himself</span>). And that still usually ends with him going back to being captured. This is especially bad because
	Eren is the type of character who really <i>deserves</i> agency and competence more than any other character, even
	more than any other protagonist. He has top marks in ambition, endurance and courage, and so it's incredibly
	unsatisfying that the writer doesn't give him an ounce of credit, ever.
	</p>
</li><li>
	<p>
	After where the first season of the anime ended, the story just gradually went to shit. It died a slow and painful
	death. Aborted <a href="/fiction/foreshadowing">foreshadowing</a>, <a href="/fiction/glory">gloryfying</a> <a
	href="/protagonism/anarchism">monarchy, <a href="/fiction/pov_lying">using a flashback to avoid telling the
	audience what the POV characters knew until after it mattered</a>, raising more and more mysteries without answering
	any, and going so long without mentioning the final enemy of season 1 (who was never killed) that I literally forgot
	she existed.
	</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Despite all these horrible flaws that make it not worth watching overall, there's a lot storytellers can learn from Attack On Titan. For one thing, it contains a great example of the <a href="/writing/rescuing_agency">dignified rescue approach</a> that I
wrote about in one of my first articles. <span class="spoiler">This is the flashback in episode 6 or so that explains how Eren and Mikasa met. When they were little (I think their age was stated but I don't remember it), Mikasa's parents were killed and she was
kidnapped by three human traffickers or whatever. Eren and his father found the scene. His father calls the police, but Eren decides they won't arrive in time and runs off after Mikasa himself. He finds the murderers and, instead of magically outfighting them
despite his inferior size and numbers, he picks off two of them using clever tactics and deception, then thinks that's all of them, enters the room and unties Mikasa, but as soon as she speaks the third one comes back and pins Eren to the wall, choking him to
death. Mikasa picks up a knife and stabs the remaining enemy to death, returning the save. Not only did it succeed in not damselizing Mikasa, the scene showed us the origin of her modern-day personality. In the scene, she hesitates to take action until Eren
prompts with "If you don't fight, you can't win" (a piece of advice that she looks back to for motivation later), showing that at that time she was a submissive person just like how you'd expect a damsel in distress to be, but the experience changed her in a very
believable way. She lost both her parents that day and Eren, being her savior, naturally became the most important person to her; so she tries very hard to protect him after that, event to the extent of wanting him to be a coward: before the battle for Trost,
where they are sent to opposite sides of the city by their commanders, she tells him, "If the battle gets chaotic, come find me, I'll protect you!"</span>
</p><p>
Besides that beautiful scene, the first season of the anime was just really powerful. They did a great job portraying the fear
of battle (unlike <a href="star_wars">Star Wars</a>) and how much the stress grates on the minds of soldiers. A
particularly glorious scene was in the battle for Trost, <span class="spoiler">after half of Eren's team is crushed or eaten
alive by the first Titans they meet, including Eren himself (or so they believe). Mikasa arrives on the scene and finds the
rest of them hiding on top of a building sulking in despair. She gives a motivational speech and gets them all back on their
feet.</span> Amplified by the music it plays, I almost cried watching that scene for the first time; I might have if I had
been watching it alone.
</p><p>
Another particularly great scene was in the forest of tall trees (yes, it's called that). <span class="spoiler">This is after
Eren and the others join the scout regiment, a branch of the military that ventures outside human territory to gather
information and maybe pick off some titans without risking civilian lives. They're chased into the forest by a special titan
with extreme intelligence and skill. Their orders are to ignore their comrades being picked off by the titan and keep leading
it deeper into the forest, following a plan that their leader hasn't explained to his troops (not because <a
href="/protagonism/need_to_know">he doesn't think his comrades deserve to know</a>, but because he suspects there's a
traitor in their ranks, and he's right). In this situation, Eren has to choose between trusting the commander or stopping to
confront the titan. Levi (a soldier between Eren and the commander in rank) even tells him that both choices are reasonable.
Surpsinigly, Eren chooses to trust the commander, but the plan ends in disaster, with Levi's entire squad being killed, and so
after that Eren tries to take back his choice and confront the special titan using his titan transformation powers, but he
loses the fistfight and the situation turns out even worse because he tried to reverse his decision. Imagine the guilt. Not to
mention the scene succeeded in a very rare feat - giving the hero a choice and portraying both options as reasonable.</span>
</p><p>
Yet another instance is the scene inside the innermost wall where Eren and co. lead one of their friends that trained with
them into a trap, suspecting that she is the traitor. They turn out to be right, but she turns into the special titan from the
forest before their trap is quite ready, and when Eren tries to transform to fight her (which involves biting his own hand so
hard that it bleeds profusely), it at first doesn't work. He ends up trying it a second time, mutilating himself to a
horrifying extent, and it works. What I want to praise about this scene is the way it uses extreme gore in an entirely
called-for way. Most of the time I find extreme gore scenes a bit difficult to watch, and this was no exception, only it was a
good thing. It was like <span class="spoiler">Sayori's death scene</span> from <a href="ddlc">Doki Doki Literature
Club</a>.
