Mistborn is a series of fantasy novels by Brandon Sanderson that boasts some cool worldbuilding and probably the best and most creative magic system I've ever seen. The premise of the magic system is that cerain people can digest small bits of metal and then "burn" it for a magical effect depending on the metal. The books (the three that I've read) have a strong plot and are well-written, and the first book is even quite good, but I would ultimately not recommend the series. The main reason is the endless bullshit [morals](/fiction/messages) in the second and third books. Still, the first book might be a worthwhile read, and I wouldn't blame you if after reading it you refuse to take my word that the next two are bad. Here's my list of objections (I'll mark spoilers):

1. When <span class="spoiler">Vin and Zane go into Cett's tower to kill him</span>, they slaughter hundreds of guards who are just following orders and are probably being coerced into fighting for the wrong side, then, when they get to the one person in that building who is actually both evil and an active threat to innocent people, she not only doesn't kill him, but *lets him go*, and as expected he returns to being a tyrant. This was the moment where Vin completely lost my sympathies and never regained them.

2. When <span class="spoiler">Elend</span> murders <span class="spoiler">Jastes</span>. Make up your mind, Brandon Sanderson, is killing wrong or not? Even when I believed in [axiological retribution](/protagonism/retribution), I didn't extend it to *repentant* sinners, which Mr. Sanderson apparently does (when he feels like it). (Elend has the completely bullshit line that "I forgive you. But my kingdom cannot".) Besides, isn't there at least a chance that <span class="spoiler">Jastes could still stop the koloss from attacking</span>?

3. That <span class="spoiler">Spook and the others don't just take down Quellion</span>. The characters even discussed it and said they didn't think it would work because "we don't have <span class="spoiler">Kelsier</span> anymore", but given how completely empty that argument was in context, it was painfully obvious the real reason was that Sanderson's morals had changed, and he no longer believed in forcefully overthrowing oppressive and mass-murderous rulers. And much worse, the statement that the city somehow got lit on fire because they "pushed the city too hard" and the revolters were too angry. Seriously, Sanderson? Anger makes you set fire to random people's houses *when you have a specific target for your anger*? Garbage.

4. How <span class="spoiler">Ruin (appearing as Kelsier)</span> tries the I Will Give You Power If You Kill Him ploy on <span class="spoiler">Spook</span>. Aside from the fact that <span class="spoiler">Quellion</span> deserved to die, contrary to popular belief, [power is something goodguys should seek, not avoid](/protagonism/power), and nobody in this world needs to hear how evil and corruptive power is.

	* Actually there was another more minor case of this in the end of book two when <span class="spoiler">Vin decides to give up the power at the Well of Ascension</span>, but I didn't make that a point here because Sanderson gave that choice bad consequences so it didn't look like he was advocating it (although I'm sure he was).

5. That <span class="spoiler">lord Yomen</span> is portrayed to be a good person on the inside, just misguided. Nobody who believes in the Lord Ruler's system of enforced racial segregation and mass slavery can be a good person, period.

6. That the "goodguys" are themselves [tyrants](/protagonism/anarchism) in the second two books.

7. That those "goodguys" have a habit of putting previously defeated badguys in charge of parts of their empire: Janarle, Cett, etc. Especially given Tindwyl's line "There are good men who make bad kings, but *there are no bad men who make good kings*", emphasis added. It baffles me, but I don't think Mistborn is the only place I've seen this.

8. The only real problem with book one: that they don't immediately tell Vin about Feruchemy and Kandra. The whole story is about trust for god's sake, and the commonly-given excuse in fiction for keeping secrets from allies that "what if one of us gets captured" [is bullshit](/protagonism/need_to_know).

9. It was really disappointing that he had Vin kill <span class="spoiler">Zane</span> in the end of the second book. He should've ended up joining them. He wasn't evil (at least, not nearly as much as other characters who ended up joining them, see above) and didn't deserve to used by the plot as a villain.

10. Atium is logically impossible because you can't know someone's decision before they've made it. It's not as bad as full-fledged [time travel](/fiction/time_travel), though.
