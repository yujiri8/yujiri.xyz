<p>
<a href="https://spellweaver-tcg.com">Spellweaver</a> is a CCG that, while not at all a game I recommend, I'll always remember,
because of what it taught me about game design, and about myself. (Disclaimer: I last played several years ago, so this may not
be entirely accurate.)
</p>
<p>
So the gameplay is basically MtG with a few rule changes, most of which are massive improvements. Creatures can attack each
other, so that the defender doesn't have an enormous advantage that encourages players to sit around piling up a dozen creatures
on each side and never attack; the speed stat is added to creatures to determine what can attack and block what; and that alone
adds so much strategic depth and design space. And they even fixed the mana screw problem! It's a bit of a clunky mechanic in
that it kind of makes you wonder why Shrines are even still a thing instead of using Hearthstone's mana system, but basically
you can exchange any card in your hand once a turn for something like an 85% chance to get a Shrine.
</p><p>
Still, the game is killed by the same thing as MtG: no concept of a power curve. Many cards are so efficient and lacking in
drawbacks that every deck with the right colors wants four copies of them period, and many more are just completely useless. In
fact, if you divided the range of strength that the cards span into three equal sections, I think less than half of the cards would
be in the middle! And the devs know that. They don't care because they think the <i>only</i> thing that matters is having a
diverse meta. Funnily enough, toward the end of when I was playing, almost everyone I argued with on the forums agreed that the
game had a huge balance problem, but nobody could agree on which cards were the overpowered ones. The forums were also a
ridiculous cesspool of toxicity.
</p><p>
Before I go on to the moral lesson I learned, I want to mention a few more gameplay criticisms. The next one is the problem of
creature size: most of the removal (cards that destroy enemy creatures) is specifically designed to be most effective against a
few big creatures rather than a swarm of little ones. This meant that big creatures often had to be obscenely overstatted to see
play, which they were, and some aspects (Nature/green and Wisdom/blue) were almost completely lacking in removal, so they had
other broken auto-includes to compensate. There were also a few cards seemingly designed without any thought of how they would
affect gameplay, like Guardian of the Faithful and Voidtouched Subordinate, both of which made it very difficult for your opponent
to profitably attack you, leading to a lot of stalemate-like situations.
</p><p>
We also have to talk about Cataclysm... the card that destroys all creatures. This card taught me what a horrible mechanic that
is in a CCG. And I will never forget the days of "Vamp-Lamp", a deck that used Cataclysm and a creature called Lamp of Zapphir
that was immune to it.
</p><p>
Oh, and let's not even talk about the insane nudity rate on cards depicting female beings. It's just shameful. (And yes, I do
now consider the game <a href="/protagonism/impurity">immoral for that reason</a>.)
</p><p>
I guess that's enough ranting about how horrible the game was. I still have to give the developers some credit for coming up
with a massive improvement over MtG.
</p><p>
A story I want to tell is that of my attempt to create my own CCG, far better than
Spellweaver, by reducing RNG, increasing skill and greatly improving card balance. My CCG died in the playtesting phase. The
reason was that although I came up with some cool mechanics and succeeded in reducing the draw RNG, I think I inadvertently took
almost all of the skill out of the game by making hands public information. I didn't realize how much of the skill in
Spellweaver was in weighing risk and deciding whether it was worth playing around a card that your opponent <i>might</i> have.
Without that, there were virtually no non-obvious decisions to be made in gameplay. But also, the dissatisfaction of playing my
own CCG taught me something else: the problem with RNG is not that Spellweaver had too much of it.
<a href="/game_design/rng">The problem is that Spellweaver had it</a>. No competitive game should have it.
I might have been able to make my CCG better than Spellweaver, but I could never make it anything more than a joke compared
to <a href="prismata">Prismata</a> or Go. So I scrapped it.
</p><p>
The last thing I want to talk about is the lesson it taught me about myself. More specifically, about self-deception. I
witnessed two forms of it in the community. Most other people did it by convincing themselves that the game was fair, that it
was <i>not</i> bullshit when they lost to whatever grossly overpowered card because they didn't draw their equally overpowered
counter in time. I, on the other hand, convinced myself that it <i>was</i> bullshit, but that I was having fun anyway. Then I
had a streak of some twenty games in a row against a deck that was essentially the descendant of Vamp-Lamp after Lamp and other
supporting cards got nerfed and new ones were introduced to take their place. Finally, I examined my recent memory and came to
terms with that I was no longer enjoying Spellweaver, and I quit. To this day I don't fully understand the reason for my
self-deception. Was I doing it because I thought it would get better with the next balance patch? Was I just afraid of what I
would feel if I left Spellweaver? What I do know is that from that day on, I have been and will continue to be more skeptical of
my own thoughts, and realize that self-deception is a very real thing that can happen even to honest people. <!--And it is never
a good idea. At least not a morally good idea.--></p>
