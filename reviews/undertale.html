DESC Verdict: it's a masterpiece and you should play it.

# Background

I heard of Undertale gradually throughout internet references and happening upon the OST on Youtube. The OST is excellent and was a major factor in me deciding to play the game.

By the time I decided to play it, I was familiar with the basic idea: there are humans and monsters, killing is always optional, and there are Pacifist, Genocide, and Neutral routes. I'd seen some gameplay and was familiar with most of the core characters' names, as well as a couple unfortunate spoilers about each from scrolling too far down in the comments on the OST videos.

Although what I'd heard about it made me worried about an ideological pacifist slant, I was interested in the idea of a story that revolved around such choices. I thought that concept had a lot of potential, and that it was less likely to be handled poorly if it was at the center of the game. And I knew the game had an excellent reputation and wanted to be in on the references and all. So I gave it the benefit of the doubt and forked over $10.

# The combat system is excellent

I'm surprised to be saying this as I went into it expecting the primary appeal to be narrative, but the combat system is excellent too; good enough that if I had infinite time, I'd probably play a flavorless boss expansion or something for this game.

The main mechanic is bullet hell-style dodging during enemy turns. There's no unavoidable damage (or almost none; there's one enemy that might be an exception), and each enemy has a good variety of moves. Just about all of them [can be evaded without prior knowledge](/game_design/trial_and_error).

One thing that's done really well is how their attack patterns progress throughout the fight, especially bosses. Bosses usually start with their easiest attacks and break out new ones or more sophisticated versions of early ones as they go on.

They also introduce a few different color-coded types of attacks and modified states for your avatar that change the dodging rules, massively expanding their design space beyond simple messes of bullets.

Your own attacks are modulated by a "watch this beam move and press it close to the middle" system, but to stop it from getting too old, weapons you find later make it slightly more advanced, like giving you multiple beams to peg and sending them with randomized spacing.

# Silent protagonist

It's a **silent protagonist** game. So much for role-playing! I can't express how much this harms the potential of a story with intricate lore and lots of conflict resolution for the player character to have no dialogue in most situations. As with [Dark Souls](/reviews/dark_souls_story), it's often used to prevent the player from asking questions that any reasonable person would ask and that would presumably get an informative answer. The player's interactions with Undyne are harmed the most.

It's not fatal though. Unlike Dark Souls, Undertale's major NPCs play meaningful roles in the story and have significant depth (that you don't have to 100%, cross-reference every item description, read game files and headcanonize yourself to the Twilight Zone to figure out - which is how lore works in Dark Souls).

# Poor communication

On several occasions, the role-playing is harmed by poor communication with the player about what's an option:

* In the Ruins after Toriel leaves you and tells you to stay put, my first intent was to obey, both because it's a very reasonable decision in-universe and because Toriel already saved my character's life; but after walking around in the previous area for a few minutes and calling her, I realized I had no choice but to go outside, even though in-universe it still made more sense to stay.

* Before the battle against Undyne where Monster Kid falls and needs help, I didn't help him because I thought I still had cutscene immobility. When he judged me for not helping him after Undyne did, I went to all the trouble of loading a save. I wanted to do everything in my power to convince Undyne I had good intentions, because I realized that like Toriel, her actions were justified from her perspective.

* In the battles against both <span class="spoiler">Toriel</span> and <span class="spoiler">Undyne</span>, you're given every reason to think you made sparing them impossible by some previous choice. If trying to spare or talk the first three times yields no promising dialogue, it's not reasonable to expect the player to keep trying it.

	In <span class="spoiler">Undyne</span>'s case, I was confident from spoilers I'd seen that she could be spared outside of a Pacifist run, so when it didn't work in the beginning, I thought I just had to deal heavy damage first. I tried a bunch more times to spare her after she tapped into her second wind, and some of her dialogue gave me hope, but she dies over time at that phase. That was disappointing. Turns out you actually just have to check the Mercy menu again on the turn you turn back to red, and the Flee option is suddenly present. (To be fair, this makes sense in hindsight given the dialogue in the beginning of the fight.)

# Combat conversation system is capricious

In general, getting enemies to be spareable involves the Act menu dialogue options, which let you (forgo an attack to) make some attempt at conversation or other non-violent action during a fight. There's often no predictable logic to what options will work. Sometimes I'd lose a few rounds trying all the conversation options on an enemy that apparently can't be talked down before dealing damage (like Froggit), and wish I hadn't wasted life trying.

I recommend asking the wiki if you want to spare an enemy and don't feel like guessing in the dark. I used the wiki heavily during my Pacifist run and never regretted it. Each character has a separate "In Battle" page, so it's not too hard to do so without spoiling stuff.

There's also the Flee command; I never figured out exactly how it works. Early on it seemed to be 100% reliable, but it's not; I thought for some time you could only flee against a single enemy, but that's not it either; I saw exceptions on both sides. I couldn't find anything on it on Google either. I think it just has like an 80% chance to work or something. The main downside for a Pacifist run is that fleeing doesn't give you gold either, while sparing enemies without fleeing still sometimes gets you gold.

# Normal monsters are boring

Most of the random-encounter monsters that you're supposed to be trying to spare (if not doing Genocide) do not make it attractive. Their designs and names tend to be jokes that all their dialogue revolves around. The point is made in some conditional dialogue that "each of those monsters could be someone else's [close friend]", but that notion carries very little power when the monsters have such un-person-like, ad-hoc psychology and never get another word after you spare them. Of course, changing this would've presented a massive challenge for Toby because it would've required thinking up a way to prevent exposition from getting out too soon.

# Humor

Undertale is denser with laugh-out-loud moments than any other game I've seen. Pretty much every line from Sans or Papyrus is gold, and the friendship scenes and most of the Mettaton encounters are [Backstroke of the West](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XziLNeFm1ok)-level.

# Overworld

The overworld consists largely of puzzles, most of which aren't too difficult, though there were two I looked up: the two where there's no explicit puzzle but proceeding involves pressing the action button with no obvious target. (To be fair, one of the two seems legitimate to me in retrospect.)

The game is significantly harmed by the lack of a fast travel and the slow movement. It makes it very unappealing to revisit previous areas, which is especially bad since that's required for a lot of import scenes.

There's also a pretty egregious trial and error room in the beginning where there's a floor of only a tile type you've seen that you fall through to a lower room if you step on, but it turns out there's a path you can walk on without falling, and you just have to find it by trial and error.

# Story

Honestly, my opinion of the game went from a 5/10 to a 9/10 just over the period *from the end of the final boss to the end of the game* on my first (Neutral) run. I can't even talk about it much without ruining it, but I guess a spoiler tag would do: it involves <span class="spoiler">meta stuff in the style of [Doki Doki Literature Club](/reviews/ddlc)</span>, and an incredibly satisfying return of someone from the beginning.

All of the main characters are excellent, nuanced and endearing and have significant development. Even characters I'd previously planned to kill, I ended up finding quite likable, and their actions much more defensible in hindsight.

Both the Pacifist and Genocide endings hold mind-blowing reveals that the other doesn't. The Pacifist ending is absolutely glorious. It involves all the characters, and an epilogue about as good as [Lost Odyssey](/reviews/lost_odyssey)'s.

I'm awed by how much work is put into the many different Neutral endings. I only saw one (Papyrus's), but I read about the possibilities on the wiki and... wow.

## Morality

One thing I'm disappointed about is that the game doesn't lend any serious consideration to the idea that it is justified for <span class="spoiler">the monsters to kill you to free them all</span>. There's not even an ending where you <span class="spoiler">voluntarily submit to this</span>, even though that's the most logical way for this to end if the protagonist has good intentions (and was the ending I thought I was going for on my first run).

Of course, I have to make the monarchy criticism. It normalizes monarchy by having both a king and a queen as designated goodguys, like all too much fantasy fiction. It also normalizes [schools](/protagonism/children). But the [enforcement](/protagonism/enforcement) of these institutions is never seen or mentioned, leaving it possible that the schools aren't coercive and the monarchic titles are misnomers, which I guess makes it still an improvement over the par for this world's fiction?
