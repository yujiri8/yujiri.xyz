Disclaimer: I've only read the original trilogy and part of the first book of the second trilogy.
</small><p>
Mistborn is a series of fantasy novels by Brandon Sanderson that boasts some cool worldbuilding and probably the best and most
creative magic system I've ever seen. The premise of the magic system is that cerain people can digest small bits of metal and
then "burn" it for a magical effect depending on the metal. The books (the three that I've read) have a strong plot and are
well-written, and the first book is even emotionally powerful, but I would ultimately not recommend the series. The main reason
is the endless bullshit <a href="/fiction/messages">morals</a> in the second and third books. Still, the first book might
be a worthwhile read, and I won't blame you if after reading it you refuse to take my word that the next two are bad. Here's my
list of objections (I'll mark spoilers):
</p>
<!--The first book is a moving story about rebellion, hope and willpower. The goodguys set out to overthrow a seemingly invincible ruler, and in the second half of the story two major disasters occur, each one on its own being sufficient to destroy all hope. But Kelsier's resolve lives on. It's beautiful. Then
another disaster occurs, and Vin has to be the one to have hope. She does, and that makes it even more beautiful.-->

	When <span class="spoiler">Vin and Zane go into Cett's tower to kill him</span>, they slaughter hundreds of guards who are
	just following orders and are probably being coerced into fighting for the wrong side, then, when they get to the one person
	in  that building who is actually both evil and an active threat to innocent people, she not only doesn't kill him, but
	<i>lets him go</i>, and as expected he returns to being a tyrant. This was the moment where Vin as a character or a person
	completely lost my sympathies and never regained them.
</p></li>
<li><p>When <span class="spoiler">Elend</span> murders <span class="spoiler">Jastes</span>. Make up your mind, Brandon Sanderson, is killing wrong or not? And even though I believe in <a href="/protagonism/virtues">Retributory
    Justice</a>, I don't extend that to <i>repentant</i> sinners, which Mr. Sanderson apparently does (when he feels like it). Besides, isn't there at least a chance that <span class="spoiler">Jastes could still stop the koloss from attacking</span>?</p></li>
<li><p>That <span class="spoiler">Spook and the others don't just take down Quellion</span>. The characters even discussed it and said they didn't think it would work because "we don't have <span class="spoiler">Kelsier</span> anymore", but it was painfully
    obvious the real reason was that Sanderson's morals had changed, and he no longer believed in forcefully overthrowing oppressive and mass-murderous rulers. And much worse, the statement that the city somehow got lit on fire because they "pushed the city too hard" and the revolters were too angry.
    Seriously, Sanderson? Anger makes you set fire to random people's houses <i>when you have a specific target for your anger</i>? Garbage.</p></li>
<li><p>How <span class="spoiler">Ruin (appearing as Kelsier)</span> tries the I Will Give You Power If You Kill Him ploy on <span class="spoiler">Spook</span>. Aside from the fact that <span class="spoiler">Quellion</span> <i>deserved</i> to die, contrary to
    popular belief, <a href="/protagonism/power">power is something goodguys should seek, not avoid</a>, and nobody in this world needs to hear how evil and corruptive power is.</p>
 <ul><li><p>Actually there was another more minor case of this in the end of book two when <span class="spoiler">Vin decides to give up the power at the Well of Ascension</span>, but I didn't make that a point here because Sanderson gave that choice bad
 consequences so it didn't look like he was advocating it (although I'm sure he was).</p></li></ul>
</li>
<li><p>That <span class="spoiler">lord Yomen</span> is portrayed to be a good person on the inside, just misguided. Nobody who believes in the Lord Ruler's system of enforced racial segregation and mass slavery can be a good person, period.</p></li>
<li><p>That the "goodguys" are a <a href="/protagonism/anarchism">government</a> in the second two books.</p></li>
<li><p>That those "goodguys" have a habit of putting previously defeated badguys in charge of parts of their empire: Janarle, Cett, etc. Especially given Tindwyl's line "There are good men who make bad kings, but <i>there are no bad men who make good kings</i>", emphasis added. It baffles me, but I don't think Mistborn is the only place I've seen this.</p></li>
<li><p>
The only message-problem with book one: that they don't immediately tell Vin about Feruchemy and Kandra. The whole story is 
about trust for god's sake. The commonly-given excuse in fiction for keeping secrets from allies that "what if one of us gets 
captured" is <a href="/protagonism/need_to_know">bullshit</a>.
</p></li><li><p>
It was really disappointing that he had Vin kill <span class="spoiler">Zane</span> in the end of the second book. He should've 
ended up joining them. He wasn't evil (at least, not nearly as much as other characters who ended up joining them, see above) 
and didn't deserve to used by the plot as a villain.
</p></li><li><p>
Atium is logically impossible because you can't know someone's decision before they've made it. It's not as bad as full-fledged 
<a href="/fiction/time_travel">time travel</a>, though.
