TITLE Review: Dokis And Dragons
NAV Dokis And Dragons

Dokis And Dragons is a fun mod where the Literature Club is now the tabletop RPG club. You play through one session throughout the mod, and there are I think 5 different endings depending on your choices (not counting the ending where you die). It's pretty funny, and if you just want to goof off with a silly DDLC fanfic for an hour or two, I'd recommend it. There are some great memes.

It feels weird writing a separate article for a review this short, but I don't think there's anything else I need to say. It's got no outstanding  problems and that's usually what I was spend most of my review space talking about.
