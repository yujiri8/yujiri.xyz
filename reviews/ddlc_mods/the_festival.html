TITLE Yujiri's review: Doki Doki The Festival
NAV The Festival
TEMPLATE DEFAULT

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLCMods/comments/7zawco/release_doki_doki_literature_club_the_festival/">The Festival</a> is a Doki Doki Literature Club mod where Monika doesn't mess with anyone's personality; instead, the festival goes off smoothly and the club gains a new member. But things don't go very well.</p>
<p>
The mod is short; probably about 1-2 hours of playtime. It's nothing terribly impressive and it's very disappointing if you go into it expecting to see any Doki other than Monika in the spotlight, but I think if you go in knowing this and not hoping for something you won't get, the mod is pretty fun.
You get to continue messing with files, see some new poems, and work with Monika against a believable villain. MC's interactions with the new member are very fun to watch.

<li><p>
Despite being an intensely Monika-favoring mod it doesn't smear the other girls like <a href="shattered_worlds_ep1.html">Shattered Worlds</a> and <a href="exit_music">Exit Music</a> do. It's more than a little unsatisfying how it robs them of agency
(<i>especially</i> the one you say is your favorite), but it's not a fatal flaw in a story this short.
</p></li><li><p>
The poor matching of poses and expressions to lines is pretty jarring in some scenes, but I've seen <i>much</i> worse and it seems to get a little better after the beginning. The dialogue is also a bit clumsy and awkward sometimes, but mostly in the poem sharing scenes. In the scenes that carry the plot it's mostly fine.
</p></li><li><p>
The average poem quality isn't up to the original game or anywhere near the level of <a href="the_good_ending">The Good Ending</a> mod, but it's not terrible either. Monika's poems are mostly good.
The only poem I was really disappointed in was Natsuki's first, which is like a version of her first from the original game that completely misses the point of it and copies only the superficial elements.
</p></li><li><p>
I have just one moral-related objection: the secret-keeping. After you <span class="spoiler">restore the file of the girl that Wallace tampers with, Monika says she has to "get her out of here before she sees too much".</span>
The right thing to do would be to <i>at least</i> tell her the truth about how she was manipulated by someone she thought was her friend if not tell them <i>all</i> the truth about <span class="spoiler">the original game</span>.
Still it's far less offensive than in <a href="a_brand_new_day">ABND</a> and Shattered Worlds because at least here there's <span class="spoiler">no overarching malevolent force that the girls really need to know about</span>,
so at least the claim that they don't <a href="/protagonism/need_to_know">"Need to know"</a> is factually true.
</p><p>
Actually, I somehow just realized that there's a plothole here. <span class="spoiler">It's established that the mod takes place after the original game, and Monika remembers it, for obvious reasons. Sayori was president too; why doesn't she remember?
I know that the answer is "because this is a Monika mod", but realizing this makes that a lot more offensive. The story makes a plothole to avoid giving a Doki other than Monika any agency.</span>
</p><p>
<span class="spoiler">Still better than Shattered Worlds!</span>
</p></li><li><p>
I also don't think the two <span class="spoiler">fakeout suicide</span> scenes do any good for the mod. The story isn't missing anything without them.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
There's also two fun secrets in the game files that I'm aware of:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="spoiler">wallace.chr is a plaintext file containing a meme.</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="spoiler">When Wallace tampers with one of the girls, her file is replaced with base64 data translating to "Get out of my head" repeated a bunch.</span></p></li>
</ul>
