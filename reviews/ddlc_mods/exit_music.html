TITLE Yujiri's review: Doki Doki Exit Music
NAV Exit Music
TEMPLATE DEFAULT

<p>
Exit Music is a Doki Doki Literature Club mod that is surprisingly dark and edgy. It focuses on Natsuki and MC trying to protect her from her abusive father. I'd only recommend it to someone who has finished all the better DDLC mods and is willing to take a lot of bad to get more good.
</p><p>
The main objection I have to it is the way it misportrays and smears the girls besides Natsuki:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
Monika has it the best. Near the beginning she <span class="spoiler">blackmails Yuri by threatening to reveal her cuts to the other girls</span>, but at least Monika eventually apologizes and stops acting like an asshole.
</p></li><li><p>
Sayori is the most inaccurate. After the opening scene where MC saves her from hanging herself, he takes her to a hospital. This already shows a complete misunderstanding of Sayori's depression. The problem was never that she doesn't feel loved or cared for, but that she doesn't feel she <i>deserves</i> to be loved and cared for. She thinks she's a burden on everyone that has to care about her. Thus there is nothing that would make her feel worse than being hospitalized for her condition. Possibly even worse, later in the game <span class="spoiler">when it's become clear to everyone that MC is in love with Natsuki, Sayori confronts him and tries to guilt him into ditching Natsuki in favor of her.</span> The Sayori I know and love from the original game would <i>never</i> do that. She wanted MC to be happy even at her own expense. This mod might make one think the author didn't play DDLC and the only description they were given of Sayori was "depressed suicidal friend". I honestly think someone who knew only that abot her might do a better job portraying her.
</p></li>
<li><p>
And then of course, Yuri... Yuri is outright villified. She takes her Act 2-style obsession (which doesn't even make sense as Monika hasn't messed with her in this timeline) as far as <span class="spoiler">sending MC pictures of her naked with his name carved into her skin</span>, and at one point <span class="spoiler">Yuri is making physical advances toward MC and he has to threaten her to get her off him</span>. And then there's the part where it's revealed she <span class="spoiler">told Natsuki that MC had decided to ditch her in favor of Yuri, leading Natsuki to cut herself as well.</span> It's an outright plothole that <span class="spoiler">Natsuki believed her, let alone that she at first <i>didn't</i> believe <i>MC</i> when he told her it was a lie, and punched him.</span>
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Despite all these horrible flaws, the Natsuki drama is good, and the ending is <span class="spoiler">faithful to the spirit of the original game</span>. It also has some good new music.</p>
