TITLE Review: Doki Doki New Eyes
NAV Doki Doki New Eyes

[Doki Doki New Eyes](https://www.cykadev.com/neweyes) is a Doki Doki Literature Club mod that explores Acts 1 and 2 from Yuri's perspective. While I have to say it's a lot less powerful than [Rainclouds](rainclouds), the mod is still worth playing... if you have the stomach for it. I honestly didn't. That's how disturbing the self-harm scenes were. The third scene was so bad that I had to stop playing because I thought I was going to vomit. Well, part of it wasn't just the self-harm scene itself, but how lightly it's treated afterward. <span class="spoiler">Yuri cuts herself so badly that she *passes out*. And then just wakes up and doesn't like, need serious medical attention or anything. She actually *takes a shower* to "clean off all the blood". Putting hot water on open wounds... great idea... and then goes shopping.</span> I decompiled the scripts to get the rest of the story.

I want to say two things in the mod's favor, though:

1. I like the way it keeps continuity with Rainclouds. It even explains why the other girls aren't sharing their poems with Sayori: Monika tells them that Sayori is feeling too self-conscious about it and that it's better if they just quietly ignore her. Sayori, for her part, just assumes the other girls aren't interested in sharing with her (we know this from Rainclouds).

2. A small step has been made in the direction of your choices mattering. If you make *all* the right choices throughout the game, you get an extra scene at the end. It still doesn't really change where the story goes, though.

There are several cool game file secrets, like its predecessor Rainclouds. The link to the full ARG solution is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aZicpnnEWcbCHuli4OoO6PhISVq6AWxiPgZqwvRa9wU/edit) (it's posted in CykaDev's discord server).
