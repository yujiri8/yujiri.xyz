TITLE Yujiri's review: Shattered Worlds Episode 1

TEMPLATE DEFAULT

<p>Puzzled Memories (or Shattered Worlds, as it's now called), Episode 1: The Voices of Different Realities is a Doki Doki Literature Club mod with... way too long of a subtitle. The premise is that in addition to the original game,
several other mods are canon. They take place in separate worlds. Throughout the first couple days of Puzzled Memories, MC begins to hear the voices of his alternate selves from the
other realities. As with <a href="a_brand_new_day">A Brand New Day</a>, he's tasked with saving everyone. The mod is extremely long - even longer than ABND - containing 14
days in addition to a few "extra scenes", and managed to get me onboard to continue the series, despite several flaws, which I'll detail below. (Actually, now that I think about it this list is strikingly similar
to my criticisms of ABND.)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I'm going to pretty much copy-paste one of my objections to ABND here: The portrayal of Sayori was inaccurate and insulting. In the base game her depression stems from a lack of self-worth and feeling that she is
a burden on MC and her other friends, but in the mod she doesn't seem to have any problem with making herself more of a burden, such as when she...</p>
<ul>
<li>Lets MC pay for her meal when they go to the restaurant</li>
<li>Guilts him into making her choice of food instead of his when she was at his house</li>
<li>Still tries to trick him into buying her a snack after he already bought her lunch the same day (<i>separately</i> from the restaurant scene!)</li>
<li>(This isn't really related to her being a burden, but it's still inaccurate and insulting) Almost kills herself (a second time, after MC already helped her through her depression) simply
because MC fed a starving Natsuki and she insisted on interpreting it as him choosing Natsuki as his future romantic partner instead of her. Come on, Sayori isn't pathetic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Still, unlike ABND, at least here she gets the chance to comfort MC for a change after <span class="spoiler">his parents die</span>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>
Another copy-pasted point, this one from <a href="salvation">Doki Doki Salvation</a>: It's mentioned that Sayori ends up taking medication for her depression, and that it's been helping. This is
unfortunate because, when you <a href="/protagonism/metaphysics">know what I do</a>, you know that medication can never directly affect a person's emotions. The mod is therefore contributing
to a false and harmful idea that people have. But if you've read my arguments in the linked article, then regardless of whether I convinced you, playing the mod isn't going to make you believe anything worse than you already do.
</p></li><li><p>
The final criticism - and the biggest - is the message that lying to your friends is okay if you think the truth would hurt them or that they "don't need to know". A lot of DDLC mods do this but this one was particularly egregious so I'm not going to censor myself this time.
Lying to your friends is fucking bullshit. Monika even says verbatim that she's been wiping the others' memories to keep them "safe from the truth", but that isn't even factually true because this mod doesn't deal with the meta-canon of DDLC! There <i>is</i> no "horrific epiphany"! If I thought the story was going
to end without the other girls finding out the truth in time to help I would have dropped the mod, but <span class="spoiler">near the end Sayori regains her memories on her own (and goes into a coma) and in later installments they do finally start working together. Thank
god. I'm still mad that none of the other girls were offended to find out how hard MC and Monika lied to them to keep them useless.</span>
</p>
<p>
The same thing also happened with MC's alternate selves (IIRC there were a lot of scenes where one of them was like "Oh no this is bad we need to stop this from happening" and didn't explain). I consider this more of a storytelling flaw than a moral flaw though, since it wasn't that they thought they needed to "protect" MC, it was more that the writer was using lack of
communication between heroes as a cheap trick to increase tension.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
So after reading my criticisms you might be wondering why I didn't give this a flat negative review. Well, the big redeeming trait I didn't mention is how cool the expanded world they're making is starting to look. You'll see what I mean when you play it... and go digging
in the game files a bit (there are some interesting comments in the scripts for the extra scenes, let's just say).

There's also some fun original music :)
