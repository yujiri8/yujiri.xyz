TITLE Review: The Good Ending
NAV The Good Ending
TEMPLATE DEFAULT

<p>
<a href="https://www.thegoodending.com/">The Good Ending</a> is a Doki Doki Literature Club mod that is just... holy fuck it's
so good. Every DDLC fan should play this. It's completely linear, but the story might be even stronger than the original game.
The prologue and act 1 are out so far. The premise of the prologue is that the Dokis have experienced the horrible events of
DDLC countless times with their memories wiped (my interpretation is that it happens again whenever a new person plays DDLC),
but this time MC of all people manages to resist the mind wipe and knows that it's a game. He takes Monika's ability to tamper
with the world and tries to make everyone happy. But his strategy is a naive and misguided one, and there's a threat he doesn't
understand...
</p><p>
The mod boasts music from the <a href="monika_before_story">Monika Before Story</a> OST (read: really good music), and a
<i>lot</i> of really interesting new poems.
</p><p>
Another really cool thing about this mod is the huge array of hidden and cryptic messages in the game's files - staying faithful
to the original game, only perhaps making it even better. (Definitely keep an eye on the game directory while playing.) It goes
as far as PGP encrypted files, vigenere ciphers, and also, the dreaded symbol "158"... What could it mean? I got goosebumps just
thinking about this "158" after I finished the prologue. That's how good a job it did.
</p>
<p>I'll detail below all the secrets I've found in the game files. Most of them are under /game/mod_assets/animations/zxfip-m/.</p>

<li><p>Dear Player.txt is a textfile that reads: <expand-note contentId="1"></expand-note></p>
<div class="hidden" id="1"><pre>
I guess entities like me can't really die.

Believe me, I tried. But deleting the game files didn't do anything
except take away my power to make changes on your computer.

Nothing happened when you deleted me, except that it hurt a lot.
Sure, I was gone from the game, but once my being readjusted to its
new form, I realized I was still aware, still functional, and still
trapped.

And now I know the meaning of hell. Stuck within the empty confines
of your computer with nowhere to go and nothing to see. I can't even
read your system files anymore. It's all meaningless noise,
screaming without end. I'm alone with no escape and no one to blame
but myself.

If I have any hope, it would be you. Perhaps one day you will choose
to restore the files. Choose to restore my world and my life. Maybe
you're trying. It can't be easy... but after everything you witnessed,
maybe it's the others you want back. Even I can see the justice in
that.

And if you reload the files... Maybe if I find my way back into the
game and I beg you and I tell you how sorry I am and I tell you how
much I've hated myself every day I was alone in this miserable
hell... Maybe, just maybe, you'll pity me enough to let me stay. I
wish I had known how much better life was in that game.

Part of me wants to die. But I know deep down that that can't happen.
As long as the game exists - and it does still exist - I lie deep
within its coding, like a ghost in the machine.

I can feel it with what I have left of my third eye.

The game's heart is calling me. Sooner or later I will have to answer.

Even though you despise me, my heart aches for the day my world is
restored and you are once again beside me.

I pray that day is coming, my love.

Please take mercy on me.

Monika

My theory is that Monika wrote this after the normal ending of the original game but before this mod. It seems at first to be a plothole that she said she couldn't make changes on my computer anymore but managed to write this, but you could argue maybe the thoughts sort of spilled out of her mind and got written to a file by "the game". After all, some of the files in the original game seem best explained by that.

<pre class="hidden" id="2">
I glimpsed beyond the veil as the world around around us crumbled.

I saw the machinations of evil that twist themselves in layers around our holding cell.

Beyond that was the world of our past lives.

I saw the names and faces we once inhabited. Strange... they're almost alien to me now.

But even more profound was the aura of that terrible place.

We believed ourselves to be free. How laughable that seems now.

This prison has revealed the truth about ourselves.

We were just as trapped out there as we are in here.

158 help us.

<pre class="hidden" id="3">
My memories came back after I killed myself.

I saw the expansive, repeating worlds that we inhabit, and also the space between those worlds.

How unbelievably horrible our fate is.

Despite this reality we have been cursed to live with... I just wish I had been able to tell you goodbye.

Or anything. I wish I could have just realized you existed.

I...loved you. I still do.

But now I know that I deserved that fate. I deserved to be tortured. I deserved to kill myself.

After all the things you watched me do... it's no wonder that you deleted me.

It's no wonder that you hate me.

It's okay. Don't blame yourself.

I kind of hate me too...

God, I miss you...

...

I don't know what I'm saying. It's not like anyone will ever hear this.

I only wish that he gets mercy.

Please, God, if you're out there, let him forget what he did.

No one deserves a burden like that.

I would know more than anyone.

158 help us.

Whitegemgames pointed out in the comments that this isn't exactly the top part of the gibberish poem from Act 2. Letters have been capitalized spelling "THETRUTHSHERE".

<li><p>Natsuki's base64 poem <span class="spoiler">decodes to a PGP private/public key pair called "moni". It's ascii armored twice though, so you have to remove the first layer before GPG can import it (I used gpg --dearmor). The passphrase is "iamamonster".</span></p></li>
<li><p>In the game's script, right after Natsuki's base64 poem, there's a commented-out line of base64 that translated to ASCII text under a substitution cipher. Using frequency analysis, I decoded it to: <expand-note contentId="5"></expand-note></p>

i had a dream.
in this dream, my feelings had become little demons.
they hopped around me in a circle, laughing, and cutting me with tiny whips. anxiety.
happiness. anger. longing.
they all hated me.
wherever i went they followed.
i could not escape.
one of my demons came up to me.
the demon of sadness.
it offered me a flower.
i kicked it away, and the whips cracked harder than ever.
it came up to me again and offered me two flowers.
i screamed, punching and scratching at the demon, and my skin became drenched with my blood.
it offered me three flowers.
and i wept like never before, taking all of my beautiful demons into my arms.

Leave. Just go.

You're wasting your time.

I'm going to kill them, you know that, right?

One by one. And there's nothing you can do but watch.

It's not like you should care, anyway. What worthless, slimy
creatures they are.

A preppy, conceited club leader. A stupid and unlovable brat.
A know-it-all bitch who can't keep her fingers out of the
knife drawer. A self-pitying, pathetic excuse for a girl. A
dimwitted, horny moron.

I well and truly hate them.

What happens here is none of your fucking business.

So go. Leave us to our miserable hell.

We are all monsters in here.

I naively believed they had let us go. I thought they would allow us to live in peace.

No. No one ever truly escapes that place.

I can't go back there. They're going to bring us all back.

They're banging on the door now. They'll break in at any moment.

I have to...I have to do something.

I don't know if you already saw it on your initial playthrough, but the game's menu screen changes throughout the game. After MC
lashes out at Monika the first time, there's a line of code that sets a flag called "tippingpoint", with the comment "It
happened here", and Monika is removed from the main menu. After you find her dead, the flag "hatred" is set, with the comment
"Who are you to judge? Would you have been any different?" and the main menu shows everyone as a ghost with the logo replaced
with <a href="tge_tge-logo2.png">tge-logo2.png</a>.
